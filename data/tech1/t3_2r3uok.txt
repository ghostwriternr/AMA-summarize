This is great!  I am going to share this with my younger friends who could benefit greatly.  What types of threats did you receive?  Were any personal in nature and not very professional?
[deleted]
Why is this market able to provide such inflated prices when the people purchasing them are among those who have the least?
What do you think the average college student could do to protest the outrageous prices of textbooks?
[deleted]
Because just about anyone can get student loans to cover the cost of them.
On what grounds are you supposedly being sued?
Thanks so much for telling your friends!  The e-mails that Follett weren't unprofessional or personally threatening, but they were clearly intended to intimidate us into quickly complying and removing the plugin without doing our research.  They effectively asked us to remove the plugin, stating that they'd "need to involve their legal team" if we didn't comply. A few days later, they told us that "we will have to take legal action" [if we don't remove it by the deadline]. We never responded to their e-mails, largely because we needed more time to do our research and confirm that we are allowed to do this.  **Edit: Removed e-mail screenshots.**  **EDIT2**: Hijacking my own top-reply to mention that we just got an email from someone at the EFF.  This is super exciting and is exactly the type of support we might soon need.
It's ridiculous that a company would threaten you like that for making what just seems essentially like a search engine. Did they provide our allude to any legal basis? 
Is this a non profit venture?
Are you afraid that Follett will be able to bring enough money to the table to essentially buy a decision in their favor? Do you think they're willing to?
Why are the online access codes (which I always need for classes) so expensive?
From a legal standpoint, what is the argument from Follett?  It seems to me that a user has a right to display whatever information on their browser they want to.  Assuming you are in no way manipulating the packet that is received from the textbook service, and are only manipulating the end result, is there any legal precedent you know of that says that you either can or cannot do this?
This is a fantastic addition.    On what grounds does Follett ask you to remove it?  Are they just saying "hey we want the cash so stop" or are they offering to buy you out?  Is there some sort of legal threat involved here?    
You should blank out those email addresses.
There are a few factors at play.  * Students *need* the textbooks, so they're (generally) willing to overpay vs. not acquiring the book at all -- especially underclassmen * Publishers are in an oligopoly, where there are few incentives to lower prices or seek innovative models that could threaten the main business line * Publishers (and campus bookstores) are being hurt by the used book market, which is dominated by firms like Amazon and Chegg.  As a result, they raise prices to try and maintain profits which leads to a positive feedback of spiraling prices. * /u/chair_boy makes a good point that the various parties understand that students will oftentimes rely loans to cover costs: drop in a bucket  Planet Money [did a great episode](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/03/353300404/episode-573-why-textbook-prices-keep-climbing) which goes into more details on some of this.
Your team provides services only in the US? Students in China need you too!
Textbook procedure on your part.
So are they allowed to do that? I can't see what could possibly be illegal about it. My money is on an empty threat.
[deleted]
what prompted you to create the extension? Was it simply you saw a need for this sort of product and made it, or have you felt the painful sting of college textbook price gouging and decided to valiantly try to slay the dragon of....i have no idea how to finish this metaphor, but some sort of overpriced book dragon i assume.? 
What about firefox support? 
What exactly is Follet threatening you with? What can they actually do?
Yeah, it winds up being a very vicious cycle, where the only people who really suffer are the students. The gov pumps more and more into these loans, so these companies, without taking on more costs, get to just keep charging more and more.
This is awesome, to be able to make college affordable for students in any way possible. You guys are fighting to decrease the 300% markup that colleges are applying to texts we barely use! My question is. WHY DID YOU START THIS RIGHT AFTER I GRADUATED?!
[deleted]
Probably because the publishers know that many students have no choice but to purchase them. So they can charge whatever they like.
Have you received any new emails or threats so to speak from Follett since you've rebuilt the extension?
Thanks, good advice.
[deleted]
On what ground did they ask you to remove the plugin ? Were there any threats of lawsuits ?
[deleted]
Would you consider making your plugin worldwide or do you still consider yourselves an American based company? 
Do they have any legal basis for getting rid of you extension? I don't see what laws you could possibly be breaking here. 
Curiously, if they are just manipulating the end result, how would this be different than something like ad block? (In the sense that it is legal)  I ask this acknowledging I know next to nothing about these things. 
I get why they -want- to take the plugin down,  but why do they think they can? 
Is the extension needed? Or could i find these same prices online without downloading the extension? 
How did you react to the legal threats from Follet? 
Thanks for the innovative idea, gang! I'll be sure to try it out.  What are your thoughts on the trend in the U.S. of the skyrocketing cost of education, and do you foresee an end to the rising costs?
Not pay for any books.  For one year students could exchange old ones or spread pdfs
Buying second hand textbooks seems to be a good option. 
Any chance of making a Firefox version in the future?
[deleted]
While this is a great tool, in my experience, the cheapest text book price is an example of the "tallest midget." It's the publishers who keep the prices high, knowing students have to buy them. Do you think the same way that eBooks have been successful and providing competitive pricing for books, Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Apple could create a similar effect by putting more pressure on text books publishers to release eTextBooks for reasonable prices? Can't wait to use #OccupyTheBookstore next semester!
Could you give us an idea of which schools / regions this plugin will service?  Is it US only, only specific schools, etc?  Couldn't find the information your website.
If you [live in a state that has ANTI-SLAPP laws](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/2qtmmj/ysk_which_states_in_the_us_have_antislapp_laws/), you can actually get money from them.  IANAL my guess is that their argument is baseless.  Using ANY browser changes the presentation of the site.  It wasn't even that intimidating outside of the fact that they said "legal team".  A way to mess with them would be to tell them, "Sure I will take it down.  But you should know that the code is open sourced using the GPL 3.0 license (or whatever you decide) so enjoy sending these e-mails to literally everyone that uses it."
[deleted]
[deleted]
This is a awesome idea so please don't developing the product. I was wondering if you plan to continue growth into other comparative pricing markets besides college text books? 
Good questions.  Follett had a few angles, none of which have much merit:  They could try the **Copyright** angle, arguing that our plugin constitutes copyright infringement by creating an unauthorized adaptation of their page.  That said, we're opt-in, so while we are modifying the web page, we're only doing so with the end-users permission.  Additionally, were not manipulating information or blocking the ability to use any/all aspects of the site if the end user so desires.  They could also try the  **Terms of Service** angle, saying that we're knowingly equipping their users to breach the TOS by using scrapers, data-extractors, etc.  That said, we never directly interact with any bookstore website, we merely supplement information provided by the end-users local browser.  As such, we think that they could theoretically go after the individual student, but they probably would never bother.  In searching for precedent, we looked at AdBlock heavily, and also at price-comparison plugins like Honey. 
Once you have the ISBN code, it's pretty easy to do a manual search.
how big are you guys' balls after making this?  edit: as a college student, will definitely check this out! thanks! 
[deleted]
Why did Follett expect you to comply to their threats?
Do you think this will make textbook prices even worse, or actually help lower prices in order for textbook companies to keep people buying new books instead of used ones?
Honestly there's not much as it's a cycle that preys on students. All I can honestly see helping any is doing everything you can to spread word and avoid paying the inflated price from bookstores.
&gt; Publishers (and campus bookstores) are being hurt by the used book market, which is dominated by firms like Amazon and Chegg. As a result, they raise prices to try and maintain profits which leads to a positive feedback of spiraling prices.  I've read they also tend to try and push a new edition out every year and make professors require the latest editions, "eliminating" the used market for that particular book.
[deleted]
Even if it's not illegal, by just filing a legal complaint, they could spend a ton more money on lawyers with bureaucratic runaround nonsense and end up costing the defendant massively.
I answer this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2r3uok/we_developed_a_chrome_plugin_that_overlays_lower/cnc7q8f), but effectively we anticipated that they could argue we either: 1) violated copyright by changing their page, or 2) broke their TOS.  On 1: we're opt-in, and never modify their page, just the local browser's version.  On 2: we never interact with their servers, so there's no basis for trespass to chattels or other claims that we are hurting their performance, etc.
Yeah there's no way I can spin it in my head that makes it even sound illegal.
Be vocal about alternatives to the conventional textbook system, which is powerful enough to thrive without offering much value to students. Try to do so without suggesting students completely remove themselves from the system by pirating their textbooks. We need to come up with innovations that allow students to get a fair deal while also not completely damning the authors and editors working hard behind the scenes. We will prosper if more people have access to more complete information and are able to make better choices on a whole.  -Ben, CTO of Texts.com

Does your plug in also provide comparable sell-back prices? 
What drove you to develop this app? Are you guys college students yourselves, and wanted to make buying textbooks better? Or did you see an oppertunity to make other peoples lives better, and took it?
No, and thanks for bringing this up.  We display affiliate links to companies like Amazon, Chegg, and ValoreBooks.  This is a side-project from [Texts.com](http://Texts.com), which is a free student textbook exchange + price-comparison engine.  In short, we allow students to easily buy/sell books with each other, but make money by helping them find deals when there are no student options.
[deleted]
Yes it's best when they *require* you to use that MyShittyLab site.
Honestly, how is your plugin any different than me clicking "Inspect Element" and modifying the page manually?
This is a tactic used by publishers to try and recoup money being lost to the used textbook market.  This ensures that even when students can benefit from selling to their classmates, that they can still get paid.
Personally I want to know which jackass email on the Follette team to send my own legal letters too.
[deleted]
Hello, my name is Eiljah Darby, what's Follett?
[deleted]
What basis did Follett use to ask you to remove the extension?  Did they send a C&amp;D and threaten legal action?
Just last semester I needed only two books, but they were both just released that year. I payed roughly $300 for those two, because I had to buy them new.   Will there ever be, or is there, a way to use this extension to find the sources that sells textbooks just out to the market at a cheaper price than university book stores?   And thanks for the AMA! It's about time to buy books for next semester, and I know where I will be going. 
[deleted]
It has to do with answering the question of who has the right to control the content, and I do not know that there is a real answer from a legal standpoint that has yet been established (which is why I am asking the original question). 
[deleted]
[deleted]
I read another question, and response, but you deleted the response.  What were the bullshit grounds that the guys threatening you had?
In all reality, it isn't much different.  There are many sites that do price-comparison (BigWords, SlugBooks, CampusBooks, and our main site: Texts.com) when you provide an ISBN.  We just make it easier by bringing this functionality directly to the bookstore website.
[deleted]
[deleted]
[deleted]
This is the crux of why we're allowed to do this.  We don't interact with the bookstore website server, just the end-user's browser.  Because we're opt-in, many of Follett's potential claims are wiped out. 
What's your favorite type of cake?
[deleted]
Piracy.

I understand college textbooks in Europe are a lot cheaper, are you able to get the prices for those books and connect to a merchant able to ship to US?

We will be coming out with Firefox soon enough. We wanted to focus on one platform, get feedback, make sure everything is tight, but yeah we will be expanding Firefox soon enough. Porting it will be easy once we get to it.   Chrome already represented a pretty big majority of our traffic, so it just made sense.  Ben, lead dev Texts.com, creator of the plugin.
you could say the taxpayer also suffers, since its the govt who is paying the interest on these student loans during the students' schooling. 
One of the biggest problems I ran into as a student was that my university would 'customize' textbooks which, in effect, gave them a modified title and a different ISBN. Will your extension help to combat that ridiculous tactic?   I'm sure it would be a long way off, but I'd love to see, for example, an extension that compared the college textbook to a different edition (customized or prior edition) and listed what content was different: added/removed chapters, etc.
I saw plenty of this in college. "New" versions with nothing substantial changed. One time I just bought the old version and used it without any problems.
[deleted]
I've had numerous courses that will require a $200-$300 textbook/cd-rom package specifically written either for the exact course, or by the professor teaching the class itself. We're required to get the newest edition which is sold only at the student bookstore for insane prices. I've had a hard time finding these books anywhere else but the store because the University has control over the book it seems like. Any thoughts on how to get around this or is this something we'll just have to deal with for the time being? Thanks for doing this AMA guys. You're doing a lot of good with your idea, and hopefully things stay positive for you all.
I'm 29 and returning to school in pursuit of a PhD and was a little concerned about books.  In my undergrad i only ever bought one book. This is going to save me quite a bit!  Thank you!  :)  Does your app also look for older editions of the book? 
How do I donate to your inevitable legal defense fund?
Good on you. Seems that you have identified any and all possible angles and insured you stay online. Do you have money for lawyers/time if they come after you? Obviously it's easier when you have cases to set precedence, and judges typically won't step on others decisions (mostly). I wish I had this whilst I was in college.   More technology and resources are a good thing, especially for business. Monopoly tactics are still alive today, and the college textbook market is a clear example.
This could, I might assume, cause a legal issue if you profit from it.  It's also a little disrespectful and perhaps deceptive to invoke 'occupy' language in a profit making exercise.

We will be doing this once we can nail it down in the USA. If we had more hands on deck, we would move on this sooner, but at the moment we need to be USA-centric.  I'm Canadian and went to college in New Brunswick, so supporting Canada is obviously something I want to do.  -Ben CTO Texts.com
And this exactly why the emails need to be blanked.
[deleted]
Seeing that Follett is unhappy with what you are doing, have you heard from any colleges threatening legal action?
yeah, pretty much everybody but the companies.
[deleted]
[deleted]
[deleted]
Thank you for repeating what the OP just said.
Not OP, but the only differences really are that it is   a)automated (which shouldn't matter) , and  b)doesn't threaten some corporation's income a lot. Companies makes ridiculous legal threats just as often as citizens (if you've ever read about a sovereign citizen getting arrested, for example), but they do it in a calculated way. The opposite example is that a lot of times companies will write that they aren't responsible for x, when in fact they are (at least in some situations), but this prevents 90% of lawsuits. For example, dump trucks on the highway will say "not responsible if a rock falls out and hits your windshield", but obviously they 100% are. That got a bit tangential, so I'll end it here.
The true silver-bullet and pie-in-the-sky is broadly-accepted and distributed open source textbooks.  There are some exciting initiatives at a few schools pilot-testing this approach.  My long-term advice would be to rally behind these efforts and support them through talks with your SGA, professors, and administrations.  Immediate steps you can take:  1) Raise awareness -- especially to underclassmen -- that buying the textbook isn't always necessary.  2) Ask the professor if old and/or interiational editions are suitable -- this can easily save you hundreds.  3) Buy and sell with other students; either on campus FB groups, or through a textbook exchange (such as our main site, [Texts.com](http://Texts.com))  4) Compare prices from services like Amazon, Chegg, ValoreBooks, AbeBooks, etc.
Which is why it's occasionally great for Professors to write their own. I had a thermodynamics professor who wrote his own, published it from a non-profit publishing, and came with a CD for NIST analysis, costing only like 80 new, 50 used? Astounding work.
in that case,  I'll be using this.  Thank you.
iAnal is my favorite acronym.
Does the chrome plugin give links to the vendors with the lower price?
[deleted]
Although you sound like you're in the clear IANAL, so it's hard to judge absolutely.  However, they're a big enough company to litigate you into the ground.  They can make your life pretty miserable and poverty-stricken by just burying you with law suits even if they know they'll lose.  They'll still win if you can't afford to defend yourself.    I hope you can stay hidden enough that this succeeds, it's a great idea!  I hope this takes off and gets copied so many times they'll never be able to figure out who to sue.  Hint, hint.
Great idea. Any market you are targetting next?  Textbook pricing and new editions are such a scam!
The new edition thing is the big money maker. I've had professors tell me "we need edition 9 but edition 8 is pretty much the same, they just added this story here and swapped these pages there" I love it when they tell me I don't have to get the newest edition. That being said, I've never bought from the college bookstore, I always buy off amazon. 
The men and women behind this project have balls the same size they were and or no balls at all.  [I've always had issues though](http://images.wikia.com/southpark/images/6/61/1403_randyWheelBarrowA.jpg)
Don't answer them, you can't win anything, only lose.  Let the lawyers settle.   Also, be careful what you write on Reddit about it, and at best: Shut up about it.
How do I donate to you?
The problem is when you get classes with required online codes.
Yep, saw this in math class. They even shifted the "tasks" around so if the teacher told you to do task 1.53 in the 2014 book it would be 1.37 in the 2013 book etc.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Read your comment to the original. Thanks for explaining it in a way that's easy to follow!!
So you are essentially collating information and telling people what the cheapest option is?      What law do they think you are breaking?      EDIT: Seen some replies below.
And top it all off they have those online applications that you have to buy in order to do the homework for the class like Connect and Aplia. Those things really ram you up the pooper when you dont even need the book but you need the homework assignments
How did you get your engine to compare ALL of the possible textbook stores, including the ones in the colleges themselves? And how did you get your engine to effectively keep up with price changes?
[deleted]
Love the idea of this site. Thanks so much for providing us broke college students an easy way to save money. My question is kind of a technical one, are there only certain sites this plug in works on? For some reason I can't use it on Amazon or the textbook site for my school. 
How well does this work for countries outside of north america? I'm a student in the Netherlands, and tools like this are always awesome to keep my budget as low as possible.

Why they mad?
I suggest to include international paper back books and PDFs. Thoughts?
What is your plan of action to take on the multibillion dollar Follett legal team?
To nitpick a bit: copyright is not about the end-user's permission. It's about the copyright owner's rights, so I don't see how it matters that the end user opts in. I think it's pretty weak, but they (Follett) could conceivably have a case of derivative work. 
Are you a lawyer? 
What is an example of the worst price gouging you've seen?   Conversely, how much has your extension been able to save folks?
Unfortunately, there isn't a competitive / open market for these custom editions, so the core price-comparison functionality of the plugin isn't all that helpful.  That said, the extension *does* automatically show any student listings from your campus that have been posted on Texts.com -- our main site and student textbook exchange.  The best way to make money / save money on those custom editions is to sell them within your local community.  After all, the *only people* who have/want that book are already on campus.
&gt; A way to mess with them would be to tell them, "Sure I will take it down. But you should know that the code is open sourced using the GPL 3.0 license (or whatever you decide) so enjoy sending these e-mails to literally everyone that uses it."  That implies they are right in claiming that this plugin is "illegal". So don't do this.
Hey there, thanks for your work on this. This is really useful for us college students. I tried it out on my school's bookstore and didn't see anything going on so I wanted to check if it was supported here yet. The FAQ description on the Chrome store says "Click here for a full list of compatible schools" but there's no hyperlink to click on for that.  Since there wasn't a way to check there I tried to email you with the email at the bottom of the chrome store description (enhance at texts.com) and got a failure response ("The email account that you tried to reach is disabled."). Where should I got to check if my school is supported and how should I "drop you a line" to get notifications if it's not yet?

I am not a lawyer but it is my professional opinion that you have the mental fortitude of a 12 year old boy.
**This may be too long, but please read (at the least) from the bolded word "also" and down.**  I wouldn't even go as far to say that you are modifying the web page.  You are an extension of the browser, a 3rd party.  At no point does your extension become part of the page itself in any way, shape, or form.  In fact, your extension reads a public website and then cross references it in other public databases.  Cross referencing tools are not illegal.  As for the ToS argument, that's just bullshit.  You cannot legally be held to a website's ToS just by going onto it.  Everyone has the chance to leave a website without having first accepting a ToS.  The ToS applies when you start using the services.  Amazon's Conditions of Use begins with this principle:   &gt; We offer a wide range of Amazon Services, and sometimes additional terms may apply. When you use an Amazon Service (for example, Your Profile, Gift Cards, Amazon Instant Video, Your Media Library, or Amazon applications for mobile ) you also will be subject to the guidelines, terms and agreements applicable to that Amazon Service ("Service Terms").  **Also,** if you are going to respond to them, I would suggest using keywords from Follett's website.  They have a whole ["values" page.](http://i.imgur.com/VacEZh0.png)  &gt; * Always do the right thing **-- Integrity** * Own the outcome **-- Accountability** * Put customers at the center of all that you do. **-- Customers** * Be open, honest, and transparent **-- Each and Every Associate** * Challenge yourself to find a better way.  **-- Innovation** * Go farther together.  **-- Teamwork**  In a response letter, if you wish to do so, I would suggest talking about your goal to make the process "more open, honest, and transparent."  You saw a problem with the prices of textbooks, so you challenged yourself to find a better way together, with your coworkers.  In the end, this is a customer-centric extension by helping those struggling financially to save money.  Helping those in need *is* the right thing to do.
/r/Murica
Spreading pdfs is the only way to combat this. Too many courses use hw straight from the back
Don't kid yourself. Follett stores do their part. A 40% markup over the publisher's net price is standard at Follett.
Yeah exactly. We are just delivering information to the user they could easily find themselves. The big companies would rather you be blindfolded.
Very interesting, and great point about the fact that ANY browser changes the presentation.  Let me do more research on this, really appreciate it!
Its not all evil. I was pissed at the price of my math book but divided among all the gen ed courses I used it for the book ended up being cheaper per class than some of my others.
[deleted]
That's what I did, or just not buy them and share or download. But this extension would have saved loads of time!
[deleted]
[deleted]
Are you scared of Follett? What will be your next course of action to make sure they will go away and let you do business freely?
[deleted]
One of my professors WROTE the damn textbook every year and required that everyone buy the new edition. For Lab textbooks I sort of understand, but actual textbooks in an introductory course that has basic information that's been around for decades? There's no reason to change the book every year!
You might run into issues with problem sets being changed (happens in math-related books all the time)
This is great, keep up the awesome work! I'm a student and i will start using this right away and encourage all my friends to do so as well, Winter semester is starting in a few days so we all need books!   Apart from Follett, do you expect legal threats from other billion dollar book companies?  And if you do, are you prepared legally? 
what can they do about it? They seem like pricks and the more attention this gets the better

Are you allowed to post torrent links of pdf versions of the books?
Well.  Yeah.  Otherwise people would have to read &lt;html&gt;&lt;title&gt;this the web page&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/html&gt; etc.  The whole point of a browser is to turn markup into a representation consumable by people.  
As you mentioned, there is a lack of legal basis for Follett's threats. Since they have no grounds on which to pursue legal action, how are they going about asking you to stop what you're doing? What exactly is their argument?
[deleted]
Good on you! You are providing a valuable service, and should be able to derive compensation from that.

How can she SLAPP? 
No, because modifying the page on the end user side doesn't violate copyright
I'll go toe-to-toe in bird law.
Did u really include their emails dude. Are you actually retarded   Also if u know anything about law u should delete pretty much everything in this comment about them 
They answer that here: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2r3uok/we_developed_a_chrome_plugin_that_overlays_lower/cnc7q8f  And it's not unusual for companies to just send out legal letters without a real reason. /r/thedavidpakmanshow got a letter from a legal department for reporting the facts on a food processing plant(?) a few years ago.    Made zero sense, but they probably shut a few people up by doing it, which was the point. 
Great initiative. So. How many book stores are used in the comparison and how do you get their prices? Are you receiving funds from amazon? 
[deleted]
Thanks so much for this, and great points all-around.  You're 100% spot-on: &gt;You saw a problem with the prices of textbooks, so you challenged yourself to find a better way together, with your coworkers. In the end, this is a customer-centric extension by helping those struggling financially to save money. Helping those in need *is* the right thing to do.  This is what motivates us, and what encouraged us -- two 2012 grads -- to take the risk and start Texts.com.  We wanted to build a no-nonsense textbook exchange that actually benefits students, and this plugin was an offshoot of that mission.  Thanks for taking the time to put this comment together.
[deleted]
Now presenting Reddit's newest product: The iAnal!  It's exactly what it sounds like. Order today for only $99.99!
Do you post prices for international editions? Several times as an undergrad I found books marked down 70% (or more) that said "Not to be sold within United States".
This is also a big part of why healthcare is so unbelievably expensive in the US. No bargaining power.
[deleted]
So if you guys are from texts.com, does that mean you would have the backing to fight this if it does go to court?
Access codes are one way publishers can defeat the used textbook market. You can resell your used textbook, but the access code cannot be reused. You can buy a new access code from the publisher, but it costs almost the same as a new textbook. This way, they make money off everyone, and students cannot sell their textbook to recoup costs anymore.  Before access codes, publishers used to make small changes to textbook every two years or so, so that you couldn't buy the 10th edition if your professor used the 11th, because all the exercise numbers were different. But access codes are so much more convenient for publishers, since they don't require them to go to the trouble to actually publish new books.
You can drop classes that require stuff like that... I know it's not always practical but if there are 5 sections of a class, each with different coursework, fuck it, take one without the online code requirement. And e-mail the professors of the other sections and tell them why you aren't taking their class. If a professor is having half-full classes while the other ones are waitlisted, this would change fast I bet.
If you're capable of sending an intelligent, well thought out response, you're capable of figuring out who to send it to without having it spoonfed to you.
I see no reason not to. It's no different than any other plugin that shows you product prices from other sites. Like going on Amazon and having a plugin tell you that Overstock or Wal-Mart have what you need at a cheaper price. 
[deleted]
I cannot second international editions enough. Not only can you get a newer version for $10 instead of $200, your professor will also be curious about whats inside the book. My professors often asked mid-class to see the differences in questions just as a diversion to keep things fresh.
What about internet explorer lol

[deleted]
One one hand, yes. On the other hand, why does someone who attempts to intimidate others with baseless threats in order to keep them from exercising their rights deserve this kind of protection?
Any chance you could reapply this idea for the web and shopping at large? My thinking is that anytime you land in a shopping page, be it Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, wherever, you have an extension that adds the aggravate price around the web plus links to the lowest found price.  Companies are storing and running algorithms on every piece of data about us we can collect, it seems only fair we start doing it for ourselves as consumers.  Keep up the good work!
Any plans to release it for Safari?
I"d call it 'cynical', as well.  Obvious marketing ploy is obvious.  
Avast! Antivirus also has an implemented plugin that makes price comparisons. I don't know if it works on this page (it does on amazon etc), but what are the legal differences for them being able to do this?  EDIT: [Here is an example](http://i.imgur.com/i8f7dpU.png). It doesn't take all that space, i only expanded it with (?). Usually it's just the most top line. Wasn't creative enough to find something were amazon doesn't have the lowest price in the first place.
&gt;I've read they also tend to try and push a new edition out every year  There's another trend happening as well. My school partners directly with publishers, who send representatives to our classrooms on the first day of school to try to convince us that the only way to buy books is through our bookstore. But that's not the worst part...  Instead of making us buy new editions, now our professors are using online materials created by the book publishers to give us homework, quizzes, and tests. These materials require an access code that costs a ridiculous amount of money. Now we are paying hundreds of extra dollars for the ability to do work and earn grades.
In my experience they just change the order of the questions. Going to the library or doing homework with someone who bought the book makes this a non issue
I'm having trouble getting the list of university bookstores your service provides for. Your [Chrome page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/occupy-the-bookstore/ipheiokfflghncbmedblogighkbongmo?hl=en-US) says they have a link to the list of schools, but I don't see it there nor on your website.  *Do you know where I can find a list of university bookstores your service provides for, or am I missing somethings that's making me stupid at the moment?*  Other than that, I applaud what you are doing.

If you google [textbook name] pdf, you can find 95% of textbooks you need for free online.  Source: Haven't bought a textbook since freshman year
I took a 100 level biology class as a science credit requirement. Figured it couldn't be that much more advanced than what I learned in two biology courses in high school, so I decided to not buy the book and used online resources instead. Made it even easier when the prof always handed out worksheets and didn't rely on question sections in the book.  Passed the class with an A-. On our last day while presenting our final projects (this was a half semester Saturday morning class), some students went to the bookstore on our 15 minute break and found out they would only be buying back 30 copies of the book at $30 each (the book cost $110 new). Naturally all the students rushed to the bookstore like crazy after class, while I took a nice, leisurly stroll to my car and went home.  Pretty much became my rule of thumb in the last few semesters of school: don't buy the book until you absolutely know you'll need it. Passed a film and lit class that had 10 required books, and I only ever bought 2. Managed to return one to B&amp;N for a full refund even.
Wat?  Are companies free from criticism now?  Did I miss a memo?  I'm almost positive you can find their email online.  An email address for a public company isn't fucking even close to doxxing.

Follett never mentioned a specific legal basis for their threat?  Sounds like the imaginary "felony interference with a business model" again.
If the Copyright angle had any merit, there could be a class action suit against panicsteve over his [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) plugin. The aggrieved class would be huge, and it could end up being the biggest class action suit ever.

Thanks, dude. TIL!
I disagree.   "Occupy" movements are (in VERY broad strokes) about fighting income inequality and the geometric accumulation of wealth by the already very wealthy.    A start-up profiting at the expense of established, oligarchical firms who earn their profits through manipulation of a system and predation of students rather than providing valuable goods would seem to be very much in the vein of the occupy movements from my point of view.
Actually, quite the opposite:  1) Give students the ability to buy and sell books with each other, at a fair price.  No fees or commissions.  If/when there are no student deals:  2) Display prices for all market-sale and buyback prices, so that the user *always* knows the fair value of their book.  Benefit from the APIs / affiliate programs of these services to power the price-comparison + pay the bills.
I feel like even telling us about what Follett did is incredibly stupid with a potential lawsuit coming.
How do you think you're going to get away with this? Enjoy jail or bankruptcy. Enjoy the welfare line.Enjoy giving college kids false hope the they didn't waste time on college by giving them a small discount on books. Enjoy having none of this matter.

Is a vendor charging high prices a [public issue or controversy](http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/responding-strategic-lawsuits-against-public-participation-slapps), such that those laws are relevant here?  &gt; SLAPP stands for "Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation." It refers to a lawsuit filed in retaliation for speaking out on a public issue or controversy. You might be "SLAPPed" for actions such as posting a blog entry, posting a comment on another person's blog, writing a letter to the editor of a newspaper, testifying before the legislature, reporting official misconduct, or circulating a petition. Often, SLAPPs are brought by corporations, developers, or government officials against individuals or community organizations that oppose their actions.   http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/responding-strategic-lawsuits-against-public-participation-slappss?  
Yeah I just stopped buying textbooks altogether.  I'm fortunate enough to be able to do that and still do well but there's always that option.
Just speculation but from what they've said on the FAQ it seems like they are indeed making money from driving traffic *away* from Follet and onto other sites. From the FAQ:  &gt; We've partnered with all the top textbook companies (Amazon, Chegg, etc.) to provide the best possible deals. When we help drive business to their services, they reward us with an affiliate commission.  As a college student I strongly dislike the crazy textbook prices and IANAL, but it seems to get into a weird grey area when these guys start making money diverting traffic away from the original site. Unlike a site like Chegg or Amazon which offer lower prices as competition, this plugin makes its money not from selling textbooks but from getting people to stop using a certain site *from their own site.*   I don't know if there's any actual legal basis to threaten them, but you can see how Follet would not be okay with this, corporate greed and monopoly theories aside. 
I buy the international editions whenever possible.  My math book for Real Analysis 1 costs 152.42 new through the campus bookstore.  I purchased it through AbeBooks.com new for 34.37 usd plus 10usd shipping.  This isn't the only bookstore that does that.  In fact, I'd highly recommend using this widget and doing the best price comparison you can.    I did the same thing with my physics textbook that was supposed to carry me through physics 1 &amp; 2 (I only needed it for physics 2) and spent all of 37 dollars for a brand new soft cover textbook.  Dittos for a philosophy textbook that went from 90+ at the bookstore to ~10 through Abe's.  They were the exact same books the bookstore had and nearly identical quality.  The paper was a bit thinner in the physics book and the page contrast slightly lower, but that was it.  Now where you get into trouble is when they require you to purchase the online access keys.  You can usually buy those separately, but it is good to check things out first.  
I have to ask, is the name is coincidental or did you intentionally name your extension after the widely ridiculed "political" movement?

Do you have any plans or opinions or insight for the used textbook market?   I have about a thousand dollars of books sitting here that I can't even GIVE away.

So many of my friends share textbooks, torrent if the eBook exists, or flat out refuse to buy the book at all. The funny thing is most of my professors are pretty understanding and one of them even photocopied the chapters we used that semester and emailed them to his students.
And their shitty software is necessary for 10-15% of your grade. I had SOOOOO many issues with those damned sites- They are NOT helpful for learning problems, their "hints" just cause you more confusion than assistance, and any "extra" characters, like an accidental space, immediately makes your answer wrong. Also if your sig figs aren't right, then your answer is immediately wrong because rounding is better! I can't believe their crapware costs $60+ if you buy the standalone copy.  I got lucky for my intro chemistry class to have a much better software- it randomized the problem numbers (within their reason) and allowed 5-7 tries, but if you answered incorrectly, it showed you how the problem was resolved. Then on your next try, the problem would be "reset", but at least now you would know how to actually do the problem and could work from there with different factors. It was like having a tutor there helping you along the way.

One problem I had trying to buy books online was that many of my scumbag prof had deals with the publishers to have special versions of the book printed for our university. A lot of publishers will print something like Math 101 prepared specially for X University. Its literally the same book but they just change a few of the short answer questions around so that when you do the homework's you will get the wrong answers if you didn't buy from the bookstore. Is there any way to address this?
Do you show favoritism to any "sellers" by placing them first or at the top regardless of price?   Does the software interface with any proprietary software with any of the book sellers or does it just search and index with a crawler?  Are you profiting from selling any books bought or sold using your plug in?  (if the answer is no to all of the above, legally you should be fine. However they will beat you down with money. Good luck.)
If every company was expected to provide their service for free just because you think they should we wouldn't have any services. What's the point of going through all this if you can't earn anything of it?
&gt; Students need the textbooks, so they're (generally) willing to overpay vs. not acquiring the book at all -- especially underclassmen  Back when I was taking a PHP class, we only used online resources. The instructor taught concepts and went through examples from w3schools that were helpful with assignments. I had him for other classes and he always tried to find ways to help students spend less on books without compromising modern text. One great example was my C++ classes (intro, intermediate, advanced). We had one C++ book for all 3 courses that was probably a decade old and we only really used it as a reference. He kept examples, explanations, and helpful website references on a server that the class had access too. I wish more of my professors would have done something like that when I was in school, but there might not be quite as many free online resources for some fields outside computer science.
Just the mere action of putting up such a sign (like the "we are not responsible if a rock falls off" sign) should be illegal.

Thanks for the offer; but as I cover above, we're a for-profit outfit and wouldn't feel right about taking your money.

I had a college professor who wrote the book which was required reading. The publisher was our own book store at the college campus. The book was printed by the campus copy machine on normal white letter paper and bound by cheap plastic spiral clips with the book cover sheets being slightly heavier stock letter paper and colored gray -- about 500 pages total.  The price for this "book"?  $170 +tax.  The professor bragged to us about how he could have easily charged another $200 for the book if he went through a real publisher.  We were expected to be grateful.  The book included tear-out sheets that were used as turn-in quizzes collected every week. He didn't ever grade them, but if you failed to turn it in, you got a zero for the week.  He would also occasionally spot check to make sure we had the book in class or got a zero for the day.  It was just to make sure we bought his book.  The campus would not allow someone to use the copy machines to copy the "book," and the professor advised us he would not accept any of the weekly turn-in quizzes if they appeared to be photo copies of another student's book.  Besides tearing out the quiz sheets to turn in, we never used the book in class.  It was all a scam, imo.
The classes with those "required online codes" burn me up. this shouldn't be a monopoly. This is our fucking edu. System! At that point your doing nothing but stealing from those that want to learn.
They don't.  Its never about them.  Reddit is a kind of fun place lots of folks enjoy.  Lots of folks are crazy as balls.  This means there are naturally some crazy as balls people here.

See identifying some random guy as the boston bomber and other incidents as examples.    This particular fucktard may deserve all the scorn we can muster up (or maybe hes just some 22 year old kid responsible for sending form letters on behalf of higher ups?).  Who knows.  Its better not to make reddit a launching ground for personal attacks (which can quickly escalate to physical attacks, getting people fired, stalking, etc etc) though because well, frankly, of tons of stupid assholes here who will misidentify people and lay a wasteland of suckiness on undeserving people
Why would I buy the textbooks when I can pirate them for free?
You're going to wake up with a horses head in your bed. 
Who made this sound? &gt;3 
When I was in college we just xeroxed all the textbooks. They weren't even that expensive to begin with but the xerox was about $10 including the binding. Why is this not a thing in the US?
Luckily my major professors were really amazing and used textbooks from the 90s (because only basic info was needed and not much had changed) OR provided PDF copies of the readings for everyone. They also left like 4-5 copies in the school libraries for us to use. Some professors are amazing, others are just friggin assholes. 
How about "Let's offer an informative service to consumers at no cost to them"?   You don't need to sound all judgey.

Hi Elijah Darby, Follett is a porn site.  
Only seems to be a massive problem in North America really. For my math undergrad masters in the UK (4 years), the stuff we were required to buy was really cheap and only for extremely specialised modules. For general calculus or whatever, they wrote their own notes with their own worksheets/coursework that could be accessed online.  The only textbooks I own are the four books that I was required to buy (for about 80 total over four years), textbooks I bought willingly after I decided to do my PhD, and textbooks I bought during my PhD. Looking at my bookshelf, I have eight books that were voluntary purchases/presents, and four required ones. The required textbooks were:  [Hyperbolic Geometry (Jim Anderson)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hyperbolic-Geometry-Springer-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/1852339349) (fourth year Hyperbolic Geometry masters module);  [Introducing Einstein's General Relativity (Ray D'Inverno)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Introducing-Einsteins-Relativity-Ray-dInverno/dp/0198596863) (third year GR module, also useful for advanced GR/gravitational waves in fourth year);  [Complex Functions (Jones and Singerman)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Complex-Functions-Algebraic-Geometric-Viewpoint/dp/052131366X) (fourth year Complex Function Theory masters module);  [The Code Book by Simon Singh](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Code-Book-History-Code-breaking/dp/1857028899) (first year Number Theory and Cryptography module).  The first three were all written by lecturers from my university and the code book is a fantastic cheap read regardless of course requirements. The GR book was the most expensive, but at the end of each year they would buy back the books from students who didn't want it after the course was over so that they could sell it second hand to next year's students for about half the price.  Edit: In this context, required means "required because you need to self study some stuff and we are generally following this book, so it would be really, REALLY fucking helpful". Some people never bought any.
They probably make very little profits and it's a business, how else would they be able to do this without money? I'd like to see you try.
[deleted]
it is interesting to read about this. here in Holland all the educational book prices are fixed. Book stores aren't allowed to reduce or inflate the prices. So it doesn't matter where you buy the book.  Good luck guys, Also, with a minor change in the code. instead of editing the website wouldn't all of the complaints be addressed if you just extracted the book information and created a popup which would give you the book prices?

Try Abebooks.com.  The US Supreme Court ruled that we in the USA could use the international textbooks all we wanted.  It really is shocking now much cheaper the international editions are and appalling.
I work in this industry. Access codes are something that pretty much everyone involved (sales, marketing, media production, support, the customer) wants to see go away. There are just too many problems involved and they really aren't nearly as profitable as big institution-or-department-wide deals.

Also couldn't find the link, and the email address is broken :(
My college does this. Professors use problems external to the book, and allow for a range of editions of a textbook to be used. This means that textbooks continue to circulate through the student body (for example, I paid $10 for all of my textbooks last semester - I had 5 textbooks) 
It should be, but it isn't. They can always make the argument "oh no, we were talking about this *other* scenario, and it isn't worth taking a lawsuit far enough to actually make them illegal.
Literally the only change in our class's new chemistry book from last year is that there is an extra page at the beginning of every chapter so the chapter review page numbers are all wrong.
Yeah you don't wanna go and agree to this being illegal though as his above comment states.
Thanks, we had made some adjustments and never got around to fixing that description on the Chrome Page.  If your bookstore website ends in Neebo.com, BKSTR.com, or BNCollege.com, it should work.  Yes, that means we're potentially facing flak from:  Follett - a $2.7 billion  Barnes &amp; Nobles - a ~$7 billion company  Nebraska Books (Neebo) - a ~$400 million company 
I giggle every time.
This is a very common misunderstanding of how legal system work.  Whether you make a profit, normally is **not** the deciding factor on whether something is illegal. There are exceptional (Like prostitution, for example)  but they are far and few in between and generally irrelevant regarding to civil case.   Your profit, however, might impact the amount of damage and punishment if you are determined to be operating illegally.

The fact is they are willing to link to their competitors... So yeah I can understand not being completely non profit. 
My college doesn't provide the ISBN. Would your plugin still work?  
Awesome! As a college student I love this idea! Will definitely spread this with my friends!  Does this plug in work for regular outside of class reading books? Or is there a need for that?
As a college professor (math), what I do is simple: I don't require my students to purchase a textbook anymore. I teach the material in class, have students take notes, and provide them with ample sets of exercises with solutions. I also direct my students to some very good resources on the web and tell them to use the library and do some research if they have questions. I also strongly recommend that they study in small groups of 2-4 students.  I couldn't have done this at the beginning of my career, because I had little original material and didn't yet have my own ideas on how to teach the material, so the textbook was useful at the time, but after a while I noticed two things: 1) I started to deviate more and more from the textbook, and 2) very few students actually read the textbook. They used it for the exercises only.
People still buy textbooks? *In 2015?*  Pirate them, use the Google Books preview to reference pages you need, mooch off a study partner's, go to a campus library and scan the pages of the textbook that you need, do whatever you need to do, but *don't get suckered into buying a textbook.*
Chrome plugins are a ton of fun because you use the power of web front end technologies but get it all up and done quickly.

You don't seem to have Amazon in the pool of book providers that you link to.  Is there a reason for this?
I just received 4 A's and a B this semester without buying any textbooks. I "found" some online and used them maybe three times.
&gt;Students need the textbooks, so they're (generally) willing to overpay vs. not acquiring the book at all -- especially underclassmen.  They don't "need" the textbooks as much as they simply value taking and passing the course more than they value their money used to pay for the textbooks. In that sense, they still benefit according to their own value scale, even when buying the higher priced books.  &gt;Publishers (and campus bookstores) are being hurt by the used book market, which is dominated by firms like Amazon and Chegg. As a result, they raise prices to try and maintain profits which leads to a positive feedback of spiraling prices.  I do not agree with the theory behind this. A company doesn't simply jack up prices when faced with lower priced competition. That violates many basic economic principles of supply and demand. Instead, the company is more likely to differentiate their product and then try to restrict access to it.  This is where new editions with minimal changes and classroom text requirements come into play. You can find the 6th edition on Amazon for $20? That is nice, but this class requires the 7th edition, which can only be found in *our* bookstore for $150.   &gt;makes a good point that the various parties understand that students will oftentimes rely loans to cover costs: drop in a bucket  This is a large part of spiraling college costs in general. Prices are formed through interactions between both the supply side *and* the demand side. Customer and vendor both have a hand in price formation. When you dump piles of easy money into the laps of thousands of competing customers and tell them that it can only be used for a specific product, what do you really expect to happen other than price inflation for that product? 
It's a side project from Texts.com, if you hadn't noticed the extension they created is linking to their competitors as well. I can understand your objection to using the "occupy" label in the username but using an affiliate link doesn't hurt anyone.

Fuckin Pearson. 
Depending on which state you're in, you'd want to frame this as    - Reducing a company's monopoly power over students who are spending Federal money (Democratic judges)  - Removing inefficiencies from the free market (Republican judges)   ...but both issues would be fairly easy to roll into one. The software author's intent is clearly not profit (unless he/she is somehow getting affiliate cash from the interstitial links) and so the motive is clearly *some* moral or ethical principle.  Whether that principle rises to the level a "public issue" is probably up to the judge.  You might not need to use anti-SLAPP -- you may be able to go after Follett for anti-competitive behavior.  
Can you repost the image with just the email address edited out? I'm curious about the email contents.

Not really.  We're still just a bootstrapped company working out of a cramped office that smells like Sriracha.  We do have a lawyer, but I think that going to court against a behemoth like Follett would be prohibitively expensive for just about any company of our size.
Isnt that what you have governments for? So that you yourself dont have to actually go and effect a law through lawsuit? :p
For a recent sophomore engineering class I took, they made "different" versions of the book for each school. I found one online and my friend bought our schools version and they were identical.

Just as easily as she gave you the CLAPP. 
They have no legs to stand on, otherwise they would be able to outlaw people searching on Amazon or Google for the same books at lower prices.   All your plugin does is automate that process.   Enjoy your Streisand effect though, congrads on the useful plugin.
You're exactly right. How are the bookstores facing such ridicule for something that is obviously a tactic played by the pubs?

Did you guys consider reaching out to some of the bigger browser/tech players here?  They may not want to get involved directly but I could see folks like google/ms/EFF/Mozilla being heavily interested in having one of their trade groups or affiliates help you out here.  I seriously doubt any of them would look kindly on basically making all plugins (and possibly browsers) a liability.    a 2.7 billion company may be scary to you, but their lawyers skull fuck people like that with brick dildos for shits and giggles.
Do you have any idea how many deaths will result from this?!? Everyone knows that any money saved on textbook costs just goes towards the Beer Fund. Thousands of kids missing graduation due to liver transplants and cirrhosis treatments. For shame...  J/k--great work &amp; keep up the good fight!

If only a browser was limited to a DOM parser and rendering engine, I might actually write one.
That seems like a very thin, very dull silver lining. 
I purchased a textbook for a math class in college. The previous edition had an error in one of the problems. The newest addition had the same error, only the numbers in the problem were multiplied by 2.  Example: (2 + 2 = 5) vs (4 + 4 = 10)

This is a serious issue forcing students to buy new books and killing the used book market. I still don't see why everyone hates the bookstore though. They carry what the professor tells them to carry. If the bookstore pays $100 to the publisher then they have to increase the price to make a profit. It's a business and they wouldn't be there if they didn't make any money. You pay a premium to the store for having the book in stock and knowing it's exactly the right book for your class. 
Thanks a bunch for the clarification!
So basically a business
Take another hit off the bong brah!
It kind of reminds me of [Ticketmaster vs. RMG Technologies](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2007/10/ticketmaster_wi.htm)  Tl;dr: One of the accusations against RMG was copyright infringement for simply using the website to test their software.   In the end, RMG did not even see trial since the big guys got an injunction granted against RMG, which basically squashed the case all together.

A BYU student did something like this a while ago for the BYU bookstore. The bookstore bought the software and now implements it on the school website. Granted, they often compare the bookstore price to the more marketplace options on Amazon but it is a step in the right direction.   I'll see if I can get a screen capture of the store page with books and alternate market options.   edit: Got it http://i.imgur.com/CQXwS7m.png
I work in higher education technology, and I'd like to say fuck follett, pearson, mcgrawhill, et al. Can you do this for online shopping in general? Occupy the Cart?
&gt; At no point does your extension become part of the page itself in any way, shape, or form.  "The page" is made up of an html document object model (DOM). The extension injects additional html into the DOM. The extension clearly "becomes part of the page" in some way.  I still think the extension is in the right here. I just think this particular point of argument is wrong.
What if it never leaves the jumpdrive. What if I just pass the drive on.  
As a student (math and chem), thank you for that.  Good lecturers are what makes attending class so worth it.

Once again, this is an issue created by the publishers. Their reps will meet with the professors to pitch the new edition that comes with this awesome access code that grades all of the homework for them. If the professor uses a new edition then the old edition is worthless. 
We have a few digital books but we need to add more support for this. It's in the oven.

When I was in school (and I'd have to imagine this is worse now) the pirated pdf's and asian books were just becoming a thing.  They reacted by putting license keys with every book and having bullshit online material you had to access.  The keys expired after a a term.    I bought one damn book for like $100, activated it (they had online quizzes) and wound up dropping the class.  Next quarter I retook it and had to buy the same god damn book to get a new key.  We aren't talking some crazy resources where a subscription model makes sense, we are talking like 5 10 question multiple choice quizes.  I'd love to have an honest conversation with a professor that goes along with that type of bullshit and listen to them try to justify it.  used copies of the same book were like $3 and worthless because they didn't have a key

What do you think will happen to the textbook industry? Will it be all digital in a few year? 
since it's all in the past... Let us know who! At least the institution if not subject!
That's still infringement. You're allowed to only make a copy for backup purposes and you're supposed to destroy the backup if you no longer own the original. The water gets a bit muddy when you start talking about "lending" or "borrowing" a book.
I took a few courses where the stated requirement for the newest edition just felt silly.  Art History course covering ancient to the renaissance just didn't seem like a few months in 2008 would change much of that content.    Also for a few x86 Assembly Language courses I went several editions backwards.  Seemed like the language at the level we were working at wouldn't change much and costs was between $0.01 or $145.

Ben and I are both 2012 grads, so we're definitely scratching our own itch here.  The dragon is a combo of textbook/bookstore behemoths, combined with student laziness.  We think that the Chrome Plugin in particular does a good job addressing both.
Is there any defense for Follett's actions to keep prices high and to try and shutdown your amazing work? Is Follett the result of greedy individuals or has Follett's hand been forced in an effort to stay on top?  To clarify, I'm a college student who can't wait to order his textbooks now with your plugin! I'm just making sure my deep hatred for Follett is well placed :). Will be sharing your work!
I had one of those where the input widget was so bad I gave up and hand wrote the damn thing and turned it in on paper.  I told the chem professor that I had tried to input it online for a good hour and it wouldn't take it so I wrote out the correct answer in five damn minutes on paper.  It was an older man who really knew his stuff and hated the system as much as we did, but was forced to use it by the department head.  He accepted the pages and I had the top grade in the class.

Hmm? I dont smoke. 
No way. There is wayyyy too much money to be made
This with the online access happened to me. And the quizzes were shit for quality. The other stupid thing was that you could pay "x" for a rental book, and "xxx" for a keeper. The book was so cheaply printed you could see through the pages and smudge the ink with your thumb. I wrote the company and asked what they did with these rental books upon return.   The answer? "Destroy/Recycle" 
What I find even more ridiculous is that if you try to buy the "access code" by itself, it's still  about $100. No book, just the problem sets.
Students and Reddit especially like to blame the book stores for high prices but shouldn't really the publishers to blame? Many books now come with one time use access codes bundled with the book. The bundles cost the store more and force them to increase the price. If the code is required by the class then the student has to buy the package with a new book. You could buy the separately but the code is often the same price as a used book. Buying from the bookstore at a higher price includes what can be considered a "convenience fee". You get the book right then and it is guaranteed to be the correct book for the class.   
I love the subtlety there.
My favorite professor basically wrote her own.  She had exhaustive powerpoints/notes for each weeks discussions with references to the 'recommended' text book for additional information.  Her stuff was totally free and you could easily skip the text book, but it was there if you were interested.    She was non PHD with decades of real world experience at an executive level and consistently passed over for promotions.  The guy who took her job literally told a secretary 'figure out what text books I need to require for the course I'm required to teach'     sooooo much wrong in higher education
IANAL lol
In law school, I bought old versions several times with no issues. 
I hate that so much - words can't describe it.  My bookstore also sells the looseleaf books only for some classes.  Needless to say, those 100% cannot be sold back.  I can't stand it.
It runs on school websites but not all. If you let me know your school I can work on getting it running their.
Re-posting this:  If your bookstore website ends in **Neebo.com**, **BKSTR.com**, or **BNCollege.com**, it should work.  We can try and support other sites, just let Ben (Ben@Texts.com) know.  That means we're potentially facing flak from:  Follett - a $2.7 billion  Barnes &amp; Nobles - a ~$7 billion company  Nebraska Books (Neebo) - a ~$400 million company
Other than donations, the only profit I could think of that they make is that if someone buys it from Amazon it goes through an affiliate link of theirs and they get a commission?
What is your opinion on illegally downloaded textbooks? I know it doesn't help the market, but if it saves me a few hundred bucks a year I feel compelled to do it.
I work for an off-campus bookstore that has stores near 6 or 7 schools. We regularly struggle with getting the adoption information from the on-campus bookstores (which they are required to supply) in a timely manner. I fully support this extension!

Ben, please reply. This is vital.
BOY I SURE DO LOVE MANHOODACADEMY.COM THEY ALWAYS PROVIDE TOP  QUALITY CONTENT FOR A LOW PRICE.  MANHOODACADEMY.COM IS YOUR FRIEND AND MINE.
They are forcing you to buy textbooks these days by having the homework submission on a website owned by the publisher requiring a product key.
I agree. But the plugin is simple enough and the code is well documented so we are giving ourselves a fighting chance.

Why would anybody still buy books in this day and age? If you really want to change the system, why not just stop supporting it? Is the goal to lower prices? Isn't the problem more to do with the fact that books are becoming obsolete?
Can you tell us more?  What are the problems involved and how do those make the codes less profitable?  From the student perspective it often looks like it is just a money grab on the part of the textbook company.    Honestly, the only classes where the online access codes were worthwhile and really helpful for me was an online principles of accounting 1 &amp;2 set where all of our exercises were through the software.  Most coursework is nothing like that and as such neither is the online content and it is terrible.
Not a damn thing.  A university needs to get serious about it and they could easily change it.    OSU as an example has an onsite book printer many professors took advantage of.  The uni's themselves need to have a top down regard for this issue, which they don't seem to care about now.  They view it as not their problem or even as an issue they don't want to step on staff's toes over when the staff is reeping benefits from it themselves.    
Troll account, please ignore.
Look at the way AdBlock works - and if they are immune legally then arguably you can also use the arguments they use, particularly given that you are not removing anything from their site, you are just adding more things as opt-in, at the browser end. Arguably, this additional meta-information can be presented anywhere in the browser, including on the main viewing panel, or elsewhere, and can be any related or unrelated things ...  
Trying to make money not through offering a product that people want, but trying to manipulate the market so that people have to buy a product they don't want.
Can the plug-in differentiate between international versions of the textbook and the original version? I've found astoundingly cheap books only to later find out the website is secretly selling the international version that has different problems and content. 
Unfortunately more often than not if one section is using an online code then they all are. Especially with math classes.
That assumes a case would go to trial
As someone in the UK, the fact that what you are doing is special is crazy to me. Every single module I took at university that was a standard lecture based course was taught as you described. Of course, any new lecturer would just use and adapt the previous lecturer's notes, because it would be stupid to start again to teach essentially the same course.
That attitude is what's driving the publishers to append unique 'course codes' to each text book, and working with the schools/profs to make that code required to access certain important systems related to getting and submitting your classwork.  You can generally buy the code on it's own, for less than the full price of the book - but not by much (and most people DO still need the book, so unless you're getting that for free, it's usually worth it to just buy the textbook new).  It's a shady and despicable practice (and the schools and teachers should be ashamed of themselves for colluding with the publishers to let it happen) but it's also not surprising.  If you start reducing a company's bottom line, they're going to attempt to fix the problem.  And large companies don't like taking risks, so they're very unlikely to completely change their established business model to meet the needs of a new generation - instead they implement ridiculous systems like the above, in a foolhardy and hamfisted attempt to *force* their consumers to return to the existing model/system.  Same thing happened with music and movies - those industries are even *still* just now being dragged, kicking and screaming, into the digital age.  When internet piracy first became widespread, all the solutions from the license holders involved DRM measures (rather than take a risk and establish a digital marketplace, they tried to force everyone to stay on the established market by quashing piracy).  It didn't work for the RIAA/MPAA - but the textbook publishers seem to have a lot of schools and professors on their side, and that gives them a lot more leverage.  So just pirating isn't enough to get the message across.  It will have to also be coupled with pressure on the schools to prevent collusion with the shady strongarming practices of the publishers.  Once they realize they aren't profiting as much from hard copies, and are prevented from forcing students to pay up via extortion, they'll provide a reasonably priced digital alternative.  But that's not going to happen voluntarily.
It's a racket and publishers, universities, authors, and bookstores are all in on it.
Well, the good news is, your office could smell a lot worse than sriracha. Which gives me an idea of inventing a sriracha-scented air freshener.
Follett gets upset at everyone that sells books cheaper than them. They've been trying to bring Amazon down for years. Good luck with that! As a result they go after the little guys as they feel they have more power there.  It's their own fault they are losing because they do not have a diversified business model. I worked for a company that provided goods to the Follett college bookstore network, basically the company I worked for had their hands tied and could only sell at Follett and B&amp;N college book stores. The company also sold online but the bookstore got commission each time.  The company I work for now has similar problems with an industry retailer and their dealer network setup. The prices of our products are almost three times what Target, Walmart and Amazon would sell them for. I think it's ethically wrong and we're discussing a course of action in-house. The retailer often gets mad at us and demands we stop selling at those places and online (that business income vastly outweighs what we get from them). Meanwhile all their customers are probably getting their products at one of the other retailers above.   Retailers need to learn that customers aren't stupid and will seek the best deal. They are only contributing to their own demise.
&gt; We never responded to their e-mails, largely because we needed more time to do our research and confirm that we are allowed to do this.  I like your team.
I used to work in a college bookstore for a top 10 US college. I personally dealt with the shipping and receiving of textbooks for courses. I knew exactly the price they charged for a book, and the ridiculous markup on each AND the buyback value they paid from the bookstore during a buyback. It was such a racket that whenever a student complained, I went into detail about how the bookstore doesnt set prices, but Follett does, and that their beef is with them.

My local community college has started adding the (inflated) cost of ebooks onto the tuition, and you cannot opt out. How are we supposed to fight back against that?
I had a professor swear that I needed the $75 new book instead of my 75 cent older version because I would never be able to follow as the pages and chapters were different.  Guess who got the only A in the class and responded correctly to all readings and discussions.

Can you add a button that would list the pricing for all stores and books in 1 view? Maybe another overlay like you have or output a csv?
Great idea! Is there a list of compatible school bookstore websites? I downloaded the extension but it doesn't seem to be working for me. Thanks for developing this tool!
You could always go to the bookstores, look at the books for your class, and write down the ISBN directly from the books.
Third Voice was something that allowed users to comment in a website overlay that other people can see.  It looks like a group tried to shut it down because "[people used the software to post lewd or libelous comments](http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2001/04/42803?currentPage=all)."  I guess that wouldn't be a problem with your product though.

The EFF might lend a hand in this instance. It probably wouldn't hurt to contact them. They would probably at the very least offer advice.   
But if they don't like it could they not stop it at source similar to how some sites stop working if Ad block is on, so put a warning sign up or fail to load properly if it detects that plugin.

I mean, I think you are missing my point. The same thing will happen to people who want to write textbooks as it will to people who want to make music or those who want to sell software. I can get the "digital" version of their textbook online for free. If I said this about a music artist, redditors would say they just need to start touring.    Why would I buy the digital version from them when I can get it online for free? 
Says: "thank you for bringing this up" Means: "Goddamnit, hoping nobody would ask about this."
Textbook companies are the worst. I'm really glad you are helping students out! Does Follett actually think they can take legal action against you?
Well he did say protest
You should ask Follette on what legal basis they would file suit on behalf of college university bookstores. Since what you're doing overlays on top of university bookstores it seems like any implied infringement isn't to Follette but instead the owner of the university bookstore. It seems since they aren't the copyright holders for the university websites they would have no claim.

What does that statement even mean? The aim of a business is to get paid by providing a valuable service, which is exactly what OP said.
offer competitive prices
I had a statistics teacher at community college that gave the homework pages for both editions of the book. The international was half the price. He actually encouraged to buy international.  He would also take our email addresses and sell our books for us the next semester.
Are you aware of 'Third Voice'? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Voice  It was a browser plugin from 16 years ago which added the ability for users to "annotate" any website. There was a huge amount of controversy given that it meant extra content being effectively "added" to sites by 3rd parties (which was the whole point).  Can't remember whether it crashed and burned over legal threats or it ran out of VC money (like everything else in 1999).
Because it's illegal?
On the extension page there's a FAQ, one of which says "Click Here" to see if it is supported for the user's university, but there is no actual hyperlink in the FAQ, is there a page on your site we can access?
Exactly. The code for my upcoming physics course doesn't come with a book at all. It's just for the opportunity to do homework, and the only reason we have graded homework is to pad our grades.  Last semester my calculus course required an online code, and it came with a textbook....a *loose-leaf* book with holes punched in it for a 3-ring binder. As if the publishers couldn't get any cheaper.
How does that not take days to accomplish? Each of my textbooks were like 500 pages (some more like 1000), maybe 4-5 textbooks per semester.
Where was this 4 years ago? J/k, good job.

They have no argument, but literally no one can afford to go up in court against them. Their argument is "stop or we will sue you even if we lose". 
[deleted]
It also suffers a bit from a similar problem to insurance... There's a divide between payment and decision making.  In the case of insurance, the consumer makes all the decisions about care but doesn't have any concept of the price.  In the case of textbooks, the professor makes all the decisions about what books will be requierd, but doesn't have any concept of the price.
I'm sorry, but Follett is well within their legal rights to do ask you to stop. Stop trying to pretend you're some kind of martyr for having a company take legal action against you. Give me a break.
TL;DR
It is wrong.  Source: I'm a web developer.

A BYU student did something like this a while ago for the BYU bookstore. The bookstore ended up buying the software and implemented it on the school website. Granted, they often compare the bookstore price to the more expensive marketplace options on Amazon, but it is the right direction.   Here is a screenshot of the BYU system http://i.imgur.com/CQXwS7m.png  Would you guys be willing to work with school bookstores to impliment your api onto their pages? Not all of them are out to get you guys.    Then again, BYU seems to like doing stuff like this. They did the same thing with Canvas to replace blackboard and then with a tool a student wrote to constantly ping the registration page. 
You know, if you go non-profit you still get paid, right?  And can still charge for goods and services and don't have to be open source.   edit: just to clarify, the biggest requirement for non-profit in most places is that you provide an educational service.   Which you arguably do. 
And they're almost always the exact same, except they'll be paperback and in black and white. Although I had one international book from India where all the little blurbs they include in textbooks were about Indian companies.

"New editions." You mean the same book just in a different order. Or changing one word or stupid things like that. 
Does your plug in also list older editions of textbooks or give you the option to list them? I often find myself buying those used and saving hundreds of dollars.
Follett can rot in hell, do they really think you are their biggest threat? How many students have taken to pirating text books now because of the bullshit games they play? 300 for a fucking book that will be replaced a year later and holds zero value? It's nothing short of highway robbery down Route Degree. And there are ALOT of Highway men already hunting that route.

Hey, I'm on my break right now and work for Follett, is this Plugin gonna screw me over in the future? Not a good way to start a New Year I'd think :c
The fact that they haven't yet been asked to stop is probably the difference. It's legal regardless of who does it.
[deleted]
It's pretty akin to advertising. And the consumer chooses to install the plug in so its not like they are robbing follet of the customers who buy full price regardless of alternatives on the market. IIRC there was a major lawsuit that forced bookstores to post the ispns of textbooks to allow student to buy elsewhere. I'm sure this is completely legal competition. 
Excellent plugin! Wish I had it when I was in college. One of my colleagues made something similar to this for book trade in values. He would store data every day on books sold and would generate a line graph showing the best possible times to trade in your book. i.e. if your CSCI book is gradually getting cheaper in trade in value, you will want to trade it in ASAP. If steady, maybe hold onto it for now. If climbing, save it until it peaks. It was a cool idea for sure.  Think you guys could include something like that too?
Why is your plugin necessary? Students can already shop around for their books.
PDFs would be infringing on copyright unless they were originally sold by the publisher. Someone could just make a copy of their textbook with a scanner but as soon as they distribute it Follett (or whoever the publisher is) will be able to take them to court for copyright infringement. 
[deleted]
Because your professor or school accepted a payout from the publisher making a special code required to access the class portal (where you look up and submit your homework assignment and projects), and put those codes in the text books. The codes are unique per text book, and each can only be used once. You can either buy the text book from the publisher and get your code that way, or pay them 90% of the price of the book to just get a code by itself.  This is a system that exists already, and is being aggressively pushed upon colleges and universities all over the country even as we speak.   So until an end is put to this bull, you certainly *can* pirate the books. But if you want to actually pass the class, you'll have to pay the publisher the majority of the book's price anyways, so at that point the publisher doesn't care what you do. 
My organic Chemistry professor was the author of the lab manual for the class. He would require that we write the answers on the "tear-away" page so that the books would need to be repurchased every year. Pissed me off to no end!
Well, if you ever need to raise funds to fight it-- crowd source. I think reddit would jump on that, with tons of tiny donations to add up to a lot.

As a former truck driver, I've had this conversation with other drivers. As a rule, they vehemently defend their "not responsible" signs, many to the point of fighting about it. The worst part is most of them are company drivers and wouldn't have any personal responsibility anyway; they're defending their trucking company's right to smash wideshields with falling rocks. 
Damn right. Send an email to the registrar's office too. If they catch wind of students avoiding specific classes due to online code requirements they'll likely advise professors to stop using books with codes. Mostly just to save themselves a headache as they try to schedule classes. 
Many countries have the same issue. It's not a purely American issue. The UK is pretty  bad with this too; there was a case a while back about a footballer's affair. A newspaper (well, a crap tabloid) couldn't publish the story because of an injunction which even prevented them acknowledging who had put the injunction in, a so called super-injunction.  That shouldn't be permitted. 
I used to work for follett at my school's bookstore a couple years after they bought out the university owned one before them. The line they always told us to tell students was that it was the publishers and not companies like Follett that racked up the prices on the books, is this true? 
If you buy the components separately it would cost you hundreds more. 
Not all people are good at it, plus this will save you time.  In some schools and classes teachers just register with follets so students have to go to their site to know what book to get.  Not all teachers give students the ISBN directly.
Having worked with academics for the last 5 years, and having grown up with academic parents, I can say this: even the smallest detail can matter a lot to a specialist in the field, and the smallest out of date detail can discredit an academic's work. So, I suspect constantly creating new editions has a lot more with an author responding to a highly competitive, detail-driven, and accuracy-driven environment than it does trying to make money off poor students.
I'm guessing it's a coincidence that my school's bookstore is on the front page, right?
HONEY, THEY DON'T SELL STUFF^TM.  YOU WILL HAVE TO REMOVE YOUR HEAD FROM YOUR ASSHOLE^TM.
Let's forget about the unethical prices for a moment because it isn't relevant to the law. Imagine that Amazon made a plugin that inspected any relevant commercial website and injected ads to its own services and products. This is the same case. I understand that people defend it because textbooks are overpriced, but if we expanded this extension to other fields, Follett would quickly become the bad guy.   Edit: tl;dr if injecting ads was legally defensible, somebody would have done it already.

Right. Everyone pointed to e-books and other paperless products as the beginning of the end for textbook companies, but nobody expected the digital content to come packed in a physical cardboard envelope, priced about the same as the original textbook...  I work in a private textbook store, competing with not one but two different corporate chains that serve our campus. I recently had a customer scream at me for "bullshitting" him about our access codes being back-ordered. He didn't understand why I couldn't just write a code down on a piece of paper for him. 
This is the biggest problem in my opinion with the textbook market and I really feel like someone should file a class action lawsuit about it. Why? They are taking an expensive book that you bought including the code, and then rendering it valueless by only distributing codes with new books, or separately for a large fee. Used books basically become worthless.

WHY ARE YOU PAYING FOR STUFF THAT'S FREE^TM ?  YOU'RE NOT VERY BRIGHT^TM .

Isn't that "online code" practice something you weren't in favor of? Its mostly my point. Piracy is almost always 100% the best option unless there is some "DRM" that cannot be avoided without payment.   For steam games its the steam client. For textbooks its online codes. Without those kinds of techniques that you call scummy, I would pirate 100% all the time.   To that point, I do pirate most of my textbooks. Even if they were reduced to a fair price, I still don't see why I would pay for the textbook unless there happened to be an online code for the class. (At that point I would just buy the code, not the book)  
No. Follets will screw you over for overcharging.

I haven't bought college text books for many years but that's exactly what it sounded like to me.  I actually stopped playing video games, until my kids got a Wii U, all together because of Online Pass.  If I were younger I probably would just drop out of school too.
But then this fucking Masteringphysics  is also required for 20% of your mark.
In my experience this has never been an option.  The types of courses I took that had online codes were general education courses where individual  professors had a lot less control. For example, my statistics courses had 5 or 6 different times it was taught, but the department made a decision that if you took this particular stats course, online homework was a portion of your grade regardless of the professor 
You just refused donations. Now I really like you.

&gt;when the people purchasing them are among those who have the least?  College students are hardly "among those who have the least".  College is an expensive luxury, and students generally have a lot of money.  Sure, they might eat ramen for three meals a day, but that's only so they can spend their money on alcohol instead.  And textbook buying time comes pretty close to tuition paying time, a $300 textbook doesn't look so bad in comparison to a $10000 tuition - it's just a little bit more to pay for with your student loan or your parent's checkbook.
I work a tech position with a high school district. One of my current projects is to build an online shopping cart for textbooks and supplementary materials. It's all based on Google Apps, so we've created a Google Site to do all this. Have you considered implementing this extension below the collegiate level? I think it's becoming a trend for the k-12 system to support in-house bookstores.   Great work on this! Wish I was still a college bro, I would have absolutely used your extension.
Yeah I do this a lot as well but some professors at my school provide little to no information about earlier editions. The ones that do... Always turns out to be the awesome professors. 
Yeah...putting these emails up unaltered was pretty unprofessional on OP's part.
Yup, I'm still paying off my textbooks. 
Delete the emails addresses buddy otherwise you're going to get perm banned for doxxing. 
It's especially awesome because now that the old edition is "obsolete", they are so freaking cheap compared to the new one.   Edition 8 = $200  Edition 7 = $45

Right, aren't there tons of things like this already? Lots of those little programs you get "bundled" with software from places like cnet already have adware that will modify the browser, and turn regular text for certain keywords into clickable links.  I guess if a suit against this extension was successful, then we could sue cnet? Although it's not quite the same thing, it seems like it would open up a huge can of worms!
Two questions:  1. Do you make any profits off of the "re-advertisement" of other sites' textbook offerings, or are you considered a non-profit (501c, or otherwise)?   2. Also, in general, some campuses offer a university-specific version of a text, that is either abridged or altogether adulterated. Does your plug in offer the suggestions for the full, original text, which can be (sometimes) cheaper than the custom edition. (in these cases, students, including myself, will actually be able to sell our books back or to other students without having to fear it being an unacceptable version of the text)  Thanks More_Momus, book store detester 
You could've at least blanked the email addresses out considering that's the whole reason they removed them.

This is HUGE with math now. seeing as how math doesn't really change and all, the college math courses now require use in mymathlab in order to get even more money. Now I need to spend $200 on a  essentially useless book and $90 for an online access so I can do homework/quizzes/tests. I've found they rip students off on math classes the hardest, probably since basic algebra/calculus don't change and they need to find a way to take advantage of students even more.
Not in engineering books strangely.   Hell my Canadian text had the same problems with same numbers as U.S. texts. Ours just used metric units.  We had an imperial answer key, so we just had to unit convert to check our answers. 
Potentially down the road.  I know a company called VerbaCompare has a solution they sell to some bookstores.
At least that got shut down pretty quickly.

Don't buy a textbook until you actually need it.  I got through university only buying textbooks ~25% of the time.  the rest of the time, i'd share one with a friend, use the library copy, or find a copy online.  My university library had access codes for most of the major publisher's online book repositories, you just ask for access and you get to read any textbook online for free.  where that doesn't work, piracy often does.  when you do buy a textbook, don't buy it from the bookstore.  Buy it from Amazon marketplace, or look for students from the previous semester trying to sell their copies on campus.  and when you're done with it, sell it on to somebody else.  And don't sell it through the university bookstore - you're just supporting their racket.  If the prof requires the latest edition, but only because there are numbered problems that he wants to assign, just coordinate with your classmates to photocopy those pages.  50c for the photocopier and a couple beers for the guy who bought the book is a lot cheaper than buying a $300 textbook yourself.

Follett owns my university's book store as well. It's annoying how they drive up even rental fees. I've found that textbookrush has had prices that are lower than about 75% of Follett's fees, but glad to know that you guys are trying something similar! Also, good luck going up against a big company like these guys. 
Does this plugin work in Canada? or is it only USA?
I'm not sure about that.  Interest is still accumulated, but you don't pay it back until you graduate plus 6 months.   Source: fedloan, graduated a year ago
It would probably help of you could somehow get a preview and compare the table of contents from both books. 
For that matter if it were illegal wouldn't everyone be all over kyack for doing almost the exact same thing with travel prices?
They've survived the coming of the Web, and they've survived Amazon and eBay.  In fact, they've thrived.  Trust me, one plug-in from one company that works in one browser isn't going to cause your employer to go out of business any time soon.
Yeah we're in agreement - I'm explaining why simply pirating might not work in the case of textbooks, because they are colluding with the schools to force you into paying up.  Textbook publishers need to find some new way to profit, rather than implementing messed up systems to maintain the status quo. But that's not going to happen voluntarily - they'll have to be forced into it.   By quietly pirating when you can, and equally quietly pirating the extortion fee when they make you, you are contributing to this end result.   I'm not saying you shouldn't pirate - that's up to you - I'm saying you (and every other college student) should be actively protesting the collusion between the schools and publishers that makes the extortion scheme possible in the first place. 
Changing the order... that's just dirty.  I'm sure that today you could just snap a picture on your phone and it would get all the questions. Smartphone cameras are ridiculously good. Lots of times my wife will send me a photo of a letter if I'm away, I can usually read everything perfectly.

If they do that, bitch about it.  complain to the prof, complain to the dean.  tell them that if you wanted to take a course online, you'd just get your degree online and skip the whole expensive university thing, you came here to be taught by a professor not a computer.  Universities are scared of online education.  use it.
It looks like people took that badly. But he's right, and it's appropriate that it shows up in this thread.    Here we have a douchbag textbook company trying to use spurious legal threats to protect their margins. We also have a company that makes money by saving people money. 
[deleted]
For me, they post the homework online, then require a code to access it. The code only works once and comes with the textbook, so you can't buy one used. Retarded as fuck. 
I think specifically this extension works with Follett e-bookstores. I'm not sure if you've ever had to deal with it, but here's my experience with it:  At Oklahoma State University, they used an old version of the e-bookstore, which let you copy/paste ISBNs as long as you used Firefox and checked the box that prevents websites from disabling right click.  At the University of Oklahoma, they use a newer version of the e-bookstore, which has the ISBNs embedded in an image. So you have to type each ISBN in yourself. It's a huge pain in the ass.  Oh, and I forgot to add - the e-bookstore is the only way to get the list of books you need for a class until the first day of class, where you will get the syllabus. But that's too late - you're expected to have the book already. And usually the Follett e-bookstore is integrated with the student information system, so there's literally no way to get the list of books without going through their integrated system. It's not like someone can crawl the bookstore and let you type in a course ID on a third party site.
But...but....it's so fun and easy to make fun of us fat, lazy Americans!  Don't throw a wrench in the circlejerk.

There ought to be a crime called academic extortion or some such. That's what this sounds like. If you don't have to take this teacher again, go to your university's governing board about him.

I love technology, but ebook textbooks are a bad idea. I've made so many notes in margins and highlights that I wouldn't be able to do with an ebook that it would seriously piss me off if I had to use an ebook. Also, DRM would take my ebook away from me.
That's just disgusting. Which school is that?
[deleted]
Could it be argued the page (source) itself is not being altered, just the end result, a copy of the source. And since the result is on my computer they should have no say how I choose to have it displayed. I'm thinking it would be like photographing someone in public. Yes they're likeness is theirs but i can do what i want with the picture in my house. If i chose to resell that image then i would run into trouble.  Cheers 
There are also many things that already do something similar. Lots of the PUPs (potentially unwanted programs) you get bundled with software from certain sites will already modify what a user sees.   It seems like if it was viable to do so, some of the major players (Google, Yahoo, etc...) would have gone after them, because don't done even modify search results (inserting links into keywords for example. And with something like AdBlock Plus, Google (reportedly) even paid to get on a whitelist.   Or other services like Pocket, Readability, Instapaper - would those all be unacceptable? They can certainly modify pages to a drastic extent. Somehow I think their argument has zero merit - but then again, IANAL!  Good luck with everything though, you're fighting a noble fight here. Textbook prices are just ridiculous; my dad just paid $350 for a biology textbook, which was over half the cost of the actual class!

We went to copy shops that had most of the textbooks on file. We'd go in, tell them what we want and then come back an hour or two later to pick them up. Yes, the first time you copy a textbook it's gonna be slow because you have to turn the pages yourself one by one to scan and print but once you have that first copy on A4 sheets you just feed those into the machine and it copies them automatically very quickly. I think those xeroxes could pump out 30-40 pages/minute.
Probably blank out the email addresses if possible dude

As far as I know, the EFF mainly stands for bigger picture stuff like going against certain bills, and rarely targets comparatively tiny groups like this.
Foreign language books have changes frequently and usually isn't much of a change at that. The fact that I can get the exact same book in France for 50% to 75% cheaper just shows that we are getting the bad end of the deal from publishers. If they aren't careful, it will go the way of music publishers with a decline in profits due to technology changes.
I'll give you that that is a good shop.

Imagine that all the college textbooks are freely available. What value-add would you provide that would make you money? For one, you could print and bind the textbooks and charge a modest amount for them (or maybe they're already available printed). Or you could sell study guides. Or crib notes. Maybe the books are free, but workbooks are not. Use your imagination.
Plus, if you did it with portability in mind, there's not a ton to have to port over. Is there even anything Chrome-specific in your actual code (not counting the file structure stuff)?
[deleted]
The paper is pretty cheap, and I've been treating this book like I'm reading a Dead Sea scroll, barely touching the corner of the page, slooooowly turning the pages, and supporting the binder at any stress points. I have one more calculus class to take, and I just know I'll probably rip out something important.
So essentially you're making the shopping process easier for the student and they want to sue you for that? Hah.

Having a conversation  about law  with truck  drivers sounds  like a dead end. I know that some a clever and some appreciate other people's knowledge, but there exists an enormous group think in the trucker community that some defend with teeth and claws. If they have just repeated a lie enough times they will be certain that they are right. This holds for a lot of communities, not  just truckers, and I know it's a generalization - but still.
It was the school's own copy center that was "publishing" the book.  They knew it was going on; a lot of us students complained about it, and the answer was something along the lines of, "Well, next year, maybe we need to charge $370, and make it more professional looking under a different publisher name so that the next class won't complain about how much we're saving them."  This was years and years ago.  I wouldn't doubt that's exactly what they did.

Although I'm not OP, I'm pretty sure that's just asking for legal action.  It's illegal (aka piracy) and crazy.
Do you see adding the extension to include textbook buyback prices too?
This really depends on how you learn. I learn from books (reading and rereading at my own pace) than I do from lectures so books were invaluable to me.
[deleted]
Well, I suppose it comes down to the class, what year you are in, and how much you care about the knowledge said class is imparting to you. I did the same thing as you for most of my gen-eds, but anything related to my target field? I bought the book and took heavy notes in it. On more than one occasion it has been helpful to have a hard-copy indexed book to turn to long after the class is done.  During my masters, it was common that I would have 40+ hours of reading to do a week. I actually had free access to all the books in our library, and a lot of students just photo-copied the notes. However, at that point, the hours it would take to photo-copy those pages and THEN do the 40+ hours of reading meant I was quite happy to just fucking pay for some of the books and be save the time and hassle. Occasionally you'd get a class where the students would all work together, divvy up the books to scan as PDFs and email them to eachother. Unfortunately, that didn't always work out in every case.  There are many fields where the answer to a question is a google search away, but there's a ton of shit that's not. If I were in a fast paced field with tons of open resources online, like oh say CS, I doubt I'd EVER waste my money on textbooks.  However, that isn't my career, so I kept my books. Instead of trying to remember which harddrive (that I may not even have any more) I saved my notes to, or thumbing through countless spiral-bound notebooks, I have a pretty substantial quick-reference guide in a variety of topics directly pertinent to my field. It's come in handy more than once.

I did something similar this previous semester. But having to buy access to things like MyMathLab, etc is killing me.
They help out the little guy too. Most often in the form of advice.
I'm sure many others have said or implied- this is a wonderful thing you guys are doing.  My question is, for some websites and universities (like mine) that intentionally list some items as ultra vague or imageless (http://imgur.com/TjeuOEq), do you plan for your tool to have reasonable predictions on what an item may be or create a crowd-sourced database (notes, links, etc about the item) to locate books that fall under that vague name? Something like that would be awesome!  Really though, it's a pet peeve that the university does this either out of sheer laziness to list the full details and images of the book, or intentionally leaves it as so we can't find it elsewhere.  EDIT: Some clarifications.
Florida Atlantic University.   Overall I've had an incredibly positive experience here, and I won't have to deal with any of this when I finish all the required Calculus and Physics for my degree.  But it's been so discouraging to see how the institution blindly partners with publishers. It's either failing to consider the *students'* experiences, or it's actually believing the publishers' sales pitches about how great this is for education.
[deleted]
Hahah.  Nearly every class I took at Drexel, at least one of the required books was authored or co-authored by the professor himself.  The professors all argued that they take the time to write the books, and they know they're good for the course.  They also argued it was an unwritten part of their salary.
Welcome to America.
If they haven't even *involved* the legal team yet you can be pretty sure this is a dumb threat from some upper management.  I don't live in the U.S. but here in Sweden the threat of legal action is almost always met with a "meh, so do it, then".
Not the OP, but I can answer.   It's required due to the way the plugin works. Basically, when you go to the bookstore site, the browser requests the page, then the plugin reads the page, looking up the ISBN for the books, then modifies the page to include the price comparison element.   So reading and writing to pages you visit is necessary and pretty much the entire function of the plugin. 
[deleted]
This isn't true. Sure, some people pay with mommy and daddy's checkbook, or have the ability to take out crazy loans/grants. But not everyone.  My parents don't pay for anything, at all, even for my freshman year. That being said, with loans and grants I was only able to cover around 7k of my 8k tuition bill, that's not including my down payment on my room and board, OR Text Book Prices.  I'm fortunate enough to have a web development job that I can work remotely and make /decent/ money that allows me to choose my own hours. So I can afford to eat well, not ramen, and have gas in my car. As well as cover the costs for textbooks and misc fines. (We have to pay for parking at my uni as well).   Even with that, I can't buy all my textbooks at once, sometimes I have to budget it out and save for a month or so. Especially when loans don't cover all of my tuition and I have to pay that off by a deadline.  And we don't all drink heavily and spend gross amounts on alcohol. None of the friends I met at Uni drank.   You've written a gross over-generalization.

I remember the MasteringChemistry days all too well.
Very true, but I've just finished a couple associates degrees from the local community college and this was there.  Many professors from the university that didn't get tenure for whatever reason, but are good teachers go in to a quasi retirement as community college professors.  Just a little something to keep a hand in before being fully retired.  They are frankly wonderful and I'm glad to have learned from them.

Chrome's permissions are not granular enough. You can say "it only works on example.com", or you can say "it works on all websites". You cannot really list domains, because you aren't able to do some API calls across those boundaries (this is why Reddit Enhancement Suite asks for "all websites" - in order to get an Imgur preview, it has to cross this boundary, which Chrome does not allow even if you've listed reddit.com and imgur.com as sites you will access).  Since the extension runs in the context of the web page you're viewing, it technically can read and write everything on every site. It's probably not going to, but Chrome doesn't forbid it.  Chrome instead needs to allow for more granular permissions.
[deleted]
And you know they're full of shit.  Good luck with your app anyway, not sure you needed to pin yourselves as the underdog.  Here's a fun question: are there affiliate links when you are taking the user to amazon to buy a cheaper book?
I had a physics professor who wrote his own book then distributed it to his students for free. That was a great class.
How does it feel to be a bad-ass?
Still doesn't sound like the bestest of ideas.
Math books are the ones that I can always find online by Googling "bookname.PDF", but I always love using teachers 3 page PDFs per class instead, it goes along directly with what is taught.
Hopefully yes, by recent graduates and 'new professionals'. But the average current college student doesn't have very much disposable income, that they aren't using to vent their frustrations, be it alcohol, drugs or trips.   Adblock and pro-bono legal help might be a better path forward, but I don't claim to be an intelligent person.

I thought they were legally required to (I used to work on the web development side of a public university). Is it a public college?
I'm having some trouble using the extension. I have everything installed and turned on, but when I go to my school's textbook shop (University of Minnesota), it pulls up my textbooks but the extension doesn't show/pop up. Anything I might be doing wrong?
Could youmake a plugin like this for Safari?
These guys should create an app that blacklist these colleges with a statement why and then provide a local option or online. Schools like those should be boycott.   A "university app"  that overlays a university's Web page warning students of hidden pay walls for grades.

Barely. The whole thing is modular enough that it'll be fine. The biggest reason we haven't done this yet is simply that we are still figuring out which features exactly will be in it and working with only one codebase is easiest. If we really wanted to we could hack the whole Firefox plugin today but we're trying to take the right approaches for the future.

Is this is specific or would it cover UK also? 
Even better is when you can't buy the code separately and you have to buy the hardcover. And guess what? The fucking online part has the ebook for free anyways!

What makes this better than all the other plug-ins that show lower prices of a product, like invisible hand? Other tools provide similar results for everything, not just books.
I've never heard of copy shops around here keeping books on file, but maybe they do, I don't know. That seems like it would create some copyright issues for the shop though...
Shit, I had to take intro to Logic a few years ago, and the professor straight-up said all the cheap books were shit, and the good books were too expensive, so we could have (for free) the manuscript of a textbook he was working on.
So it's like any average business. 
They are getting affiliate cash
If you fail the exam and do the course again the 20% won't count. Thats what I have been doing. Im studying applied physics and haven't spend a dime for my books.
Hmm... mind shooting us an email to admin@texts.com?  We'll play around to figure out what is going on.
In the UK a lot of shops say something like "no returns (does not affect statutory rights)". This way they can give the impression that they won't take returns, except they are obliged to by statute under certain circumstances (faulty item, not as described, etc).

I hate how people always say a businesses sole reason to exist is to generate money and that somehow defends any of their actions. I'd argue that's not it's sole reason to exist, it's at least equally so to provide a valuable service or commodity. It won't exist without generating a profit, but some businesses are truly more valuable than others. 
Hey, I don't have any real questions but wanted to say that without their lawsuit I would have never learned about your plugin or website.

On what grounds did they demand the app be taken down? It doesn't cause any changes to their site nor disrupt their business. The app is clearly 100% on the end user's experience, which they have to willingly and knowingly add to their browser.

It is a fairly common practice to try to 'intimidate' your competitors especially those much smaller than you with legal threats, enough people will respond 'oh shit they're gonna get lawyers involved, I can't afford that, I'll do what they ask' to make it worth their while doing, after all it takes, what, thirty seconds to send out the email and if you comply then that was thirty seconds well spent. However if you know or look into the law and discover that their threats are farily empty they've only wasted thirty seconds.

In my second semester of college right now, what tips/advice do you have to offer regarding textbooks or just college in general?  I really hope you guys can somehow shape up the fuckery known as the textbook industry.
I've seriously considered going back to school to become a lawyer, but just the fear of not being able to use that acronym stops me.
You guys do an awesome job! I was gonna buy an eco textbook for $250 new ($200 used) at my school where as it was just $44 new online (or $20 for a very very good used copy).  Is what you guys doing illegal in a sense or is it a civil case? If so, what are their allegations?
It's just an extension (That's automatically on..). I've put an example in the parent post. It makes it "safe" in the way, that you don't get screwed by retailers, in terms of price and shipping.
[deleted]
That's not gonna work, they know you're there for a degree, not for an education.
I actually think I agree with what you are doing, but do you not realize just how MUCH the used book market is harming textbook companies? Their only real point of revenue at this point is the first year of sells. Just as devils advocate, can you not understand that you could be destroying these textbook companies with a single chrome extension, and how do you feel about that?
Mostly there are a lot of support issues with codes not working. It just doesn't make sense where you could just bill the school based on their usage instead.  Here is the way I see it: the content mostly benefits the instructor who could otherwise make their own supplemental content if they had or took the time to do so. I don't think it's fair for them to push the cost of that on the students.

They were doing that in 1988 when I was in college. Sometimes they just reordered the page numbers so you couldn't follow along and required you buy the new version.   Also many of the teachers authored their own textbooks which they would change up a bit each year.   The whole business is a racket top to bottom.
Really interesting approach - I love how you've decided to use an overlay instead of developing yet another meta-search site.   1) Have you considered enabling more options for your search engines? I'm mostly thinking a checkmark on whether or not you include e-books in the searches, and/or used books (with an edition checker).  2) Have you considered including libraries as a search option? I find it odd how few people seem to use libraries when they need books for 2-3 weeks or so, this might not be relevant for all fields, but some courses uses quite a bit of different source litterature, hence why this might be an option for users.  3) Using the #occupy terminology and referring mainly to one site seems a bit odd to me, have you any plans about enabling users to suggest alternative sites, possibly with a peer-review (crowdsourcing it to other users) removing spam and more expensive plugs?
Had a professor write his own book in broken english and then put a code in the back that would basically redeem 10% of your grade.  Shit was crooked as all hell.
Top half: ToS Argument and Copyright argument are bullshit.  Bottom Half: Use the words of the company threatening to sue back against them.
It wouldn't need to.  OP doesn't have a large business, it's just him and another dude.  It wouldn't take much to swamp them with legal fees well before a case went to trial.
It seems to me like it's just an attempt to stamp out potential competition by cloaking price comparison.  Honestly, how much different is your plug in function than something like gas budddy?
[deleted]
no, this is more like going into a Best Buy and telling customers they can get their product for cheaper at Target. I just hope the creators of the plugin formed an LLC first
You guys couldn't have done this when I was in college?
Does the extension only work on select websites? Or does it read the prices while browsing Amazon and other sites like Chegg?

Oh shit. This will make buying books so much easier... I've always used Google to find the lowest prices on books, but it took forever.   What inspired you to create this? And do you only look through a predetermined list of sites or any site that is selling the book? 
?
Businesses gon business, it's their right. But this wouldn't work if the schools didn't go along with it. Blame the schools.
Why have you chosen to brand this with the "occupy" name?
Naww dude, all other companies are literally Satan.
Not only that but more and more schools are going to all e-books so you get charged for the book regardless.

Buying the code off My Math Lab is usually cheaper than the bookstore, also they give you a copy of the e-book with the purchase.*   *(Others experience may be different but since I go to tiny community college, I doubt we have a big contract.)

Well to be fair, the UK's tabloid culture is horrendous about publishing any and all personal information in stories. I heard about a missing person who the only way anyone knew they were still alive was that their voice mail was being checked regularly, but it turned out that a tabloid reporter had broken in and was using the voice mails as part of their story.
Fight the power!
And some are run by good people who like having money to live but also care a lot about ethics. Unfortunately that is rare with public companies.
Correct me if I am wrong but they still need to get their site out there so students know it actually exists. But yea, they still need to be careful, and not answer those emails directly.
I am a software engineer that graduated this past May. I want to create a plugin or site that allows users to map question sets from one year's edition to a different years edition (e.g., this year's Problem #3.14 is last year's Problem #1.59) Would you be interested in working together, making this functionality a part of your site? I envision a user finding their book, choosing the edition to "convert" it to, and having the selected edition order appear (with new questions highlighted so they know they are not found in the selected edition).

Related to your last point: college is usually pretty expensive, and textbooks are relatively small potatoes by comparison. Humans tend to judge costs in a relative fashion, even though this isn't logical. For example, many people will spend an extra five minutes to save $5 on a gallon of milk, while they will not spend an extra five minutes to save $5 on a $1,000 TV, even though the net gain is identical in both cases. You can see this happen repeatedly as people buy big-ticket items, especially houses and cars. I'm spending $300,000 on a house, they'll think, what's an extra $1000 for this random insurance? Same sort of thinking with extended warranties or pointless accessories: I'm spending $1,000 on a TV, what's an extra $50?  This seems like the most interesting aspect for your particular business model, since you need to overcome that psychological barrier to get your potential users to *want* to save money, when they're predisposed not to.
Yea, that's been a pretty serious case over here and many people have gone to prison (in general over unauthorised voicemail access, or "phone hacking" as the media likes to use.)
Every business rapes their customers. The only difference is the size of the penis. 
I passed Physics 2 this last semester and I couldn't be happier to be done with the impassible shit storm that is MasteringPhysics. And you can't just buy that, you also need a Chegg subscription so that the problems are possible in a reasonable amount of time!
I'm just wondering why an *antivirus* company is pushing a *shopping* plugin.  I guess the sales and marketing department decided "let's buy a shopping-helper plugin and slap our brand name on it to lend it credibility and get us affiliate kickbacks."  Are they marketing it as "we'll actively create a better product than all the other shitty shopping plugins, and you can trust it because our business specializes in removing shitty software?"  It reeks of the same shit that people install AV for: clearing out unwanted browser toolbars that came bundled with unrelated apps.
This is exactly why we built it!  We plan on adding more functionality to the plugin as well in the way of offering suggestions for textbook alternatives. We do this on the main Texts.com website a bit already, for example:  https://texts.com/books/9781429251631
[deleted]
Thanks for the questions, I can tell you have a good sense of what's going on.  0) We're actually "guilty" of creating a meta-search site as our core business: Texts.com.  But we think ours is pretty solid, and is built *completely* around a free student-to-student exchange.  1) Yes, definitely in the works.  2) Also great feedback.  There aren't an abundance of ready-to-go public-library APIs, though we're definitely open to implementing them if we can make it happen.  In the interim, we'd like to include results from Project Gutenberg and other royalty-free repositories.  3) Yeah, we sort of grabbed onto the "Occupy" moniker once we realized we may be fighting Follett.  We laso liked the fact that we're "occupying" their site.  We are already doing some cool stuff, including a beta-feature that is adding alternatives (old / international editions) to our search results on Texts.com, which we plan on opening up to crowd-suggestions soon.
Does this work on any college/university bookstore website?
Hadn't heard of Gas Buddy, but I have to imagine that all price-comparison services are somewhat similar.  The plugin relies on our internal Texts.com API, but other sites do price-comparison for textbooks also: SlugBooks, BigWords, etc.
Pay a lawyer and do some proper due dil. It will reflect well if they do actually follow through. 
This is absolutely the kind of thing we are interested in doing! Let us calm down from the AMA buzz and we can talk more.
That analogy seems really stretched though, because this is just an extension that users can optionally download.  It's much more like making a phone app that people could take into Best Buy and it would tell them whether Target had cheaper prices.
Sounds a lot like iphones
Fundamentally, it's not all that different from taking the ISBN and then loading it into BigWords, SlugBooks, Book.ly, or any other site.  We just try to simplify the process.  There's also the added benefit that this relies on our internal Texts.com API, which automatically folds in any students listings at your school.  But yeah, not fundamentally dissimilar - maybe marginally more convenient.
Dude I feel you. I had to pay $93 this past semester for the online access to the textbook and the required MyStatLab for my Statistics course. I didn't really use the online textbook so I effectively paid $93 to do my required weekly assignments...

Well, when do you expect to get sued? This is a serious question btw. I don't doubt that your business is completely legal, but they still might to try to push you out through massive legal costs.

What do you believe needs to happen in order for open source textbooks to gain popularity in campuses?  In other words, what keeps the publisher/bookstore oligopoly intact? I realize that they have a captive market, but why do professors and/or academic departments choose *their* books and not open source textbooks?
Can't the college bookstore websites just detect that the user has the plugin enabled and ask them to turn it off unorder to get into the website? Just like how CBS.com ect can do this to people that have adBlock on?

Are there any plans to monetize this plugin?
I happen to work for a small company that sells books across almost all the venues mentioned here.  I want to give you a big thank you for doing this AMA and spreading awareness about alternative solutions to overpaying at college book stores.  My question is, ultimately, do you feel the solution to the problem of overpriced textbooks will not be an increase in the used book market, but one in the rental/e-book market?
I love this. Thank you so much for going out of your way to promote education in this country.  Are you guys involved in any efforts to create an open-source textbook website?
Maybe they figured if they offer a safe, reliable alternative people won't download something that is potentially adware. Just a thought it could easily  be what you said or a combination or maybe the CEOs kid made this one.
Just sent you a free pizza, be sure to open the door when it comes?
My speculation is that there's just little (direct) incentive for professors / academic departments to take the risk on a new and unproven model.  As more and more schools take the plunge, there will be broader confidence and support for these efforts, which will act like a positive feedback loop of salvation.
[deleted]
I mentioned this above, by some schools are also now partnering with companies like VitalSource and are going 100% e-book. My school did this recently and now you have to pay for the e-book from them, so they get the money regardless. 
&gt; do you not realize just how MUCH the used book market is harming textbook companies?   Then maybe they should find new business ventures where they feel more confident they can add value to the consumer.
Finding the lowest price on something is not an educational service. It's customer service. 
I can usually find it but my school just tries to make it as difficult as possible it seems. And a lot of the time, the books are unique to the school (certain selection of the text, written by the teacher, etc.) It's annoying, man. 
Does Texts.com take into account Kindle listings?

This could potentially open up a shit storm that could keep things as they are, or break the web entirely. If the supreme court has to get involved, they could very well rule that basically client-side DOM and JS manipulation of websites is illegal.

It's on the way! Really we just have to nail down what exactly we want for functionality then building for Firefox will be easy enough, but we don't want to bother with that until we have learned what features to add or chop.
Hi what exactly do you mean "build something yourself" in the first edit point?
Basically show up to a meeting with a printout of the raw file their server actually sends to customers.   At the end of the day they are trusting that chrome/firefox/ie/whatever comply to html/css/etc. standards and display as intended. Can they sue google if mobile chrome mangles their website or inserts their own ads?
I spent *waaay* too long laughing at the gallery for this plugin. It gets even funnier if you combine it with the disclaimer in a follow-on comment about IANAL.  So you could say, "IANAL, but you don't know where your information is in my butt."  Maybe I should fork the extension and add this. Uh, but then that would mean forking my butt, which ..., nah, not before noon.
I wouldn't want to subject a cactus to that.
Well, I didn't mean to suggest it isn't their right. Just pointing out the business strategy. People can draw their own conclusions. 
Community college, 1 book, 3 months rental... $187. One edition older on amazon... $3.99. When they said "the children are our future." I didn't realize it was meant in the same context as [cattle.](http://imgur.com/hVAG5th)
[deleted]
Most importantly, have you considered searching for textbooks that are one edition older? The price difference is obscene. Also, have you considered working with similar websites like http://www.gettextbooks.com that have a huge presence already?
While that users' advice is wonderful and very damning for Follet, please do not send them an email like that. Do not send them any emails. Hire a lawyer, and let the lawyer talk.

Truckers don't become lawyers for several reasons. One of those reasons (besides the love of the open road and truck stop food) may be related to the inability of the average truck driver to understand that posting a sign does not limit your liability or responsibility. 
I was referring to federally subsidized loans, where the gov't pays the interest on your loans while you're in school and for 6 months after you graduate. Your loans must have been unsubsidized if your interest accumulated. source: also a college grad who has both kinds of loans, also this link https://studentaid.ed.gov/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized#subsidized-vs-unsubsidized
Before #OccupyTheBookstore happened, I've always used http://www.gettextbooks.com
They can, but im pretty sure there is a way around that too....  I pretty much use the school bookstore site to find the book titles, then buy them on Amazon.  except those damn "university edition" books that can only be gotten at the university.
Their plugin is aimed at the scumbag bookstore chain, not the book publishers.
&gt; One of my professors WROTE the damn textbook every year and required that everyone buy the new edition.  He or she is probably not paid all that much. This is a nice bonus.
Apparently I can't just post without asking a question, but I just wanted to say you're awesome for doing this. My token question is, what's your favourite cheese?
yeah. The thing I hate the most is University edition books that can't be gotten elsewhere. makes me want to start buying the books, digitizing them, and distributing them for free to students who need them... but that would be highly illegal.
Even if the "values" Follett has was made up by the marketing department, which is very likely, it is always better to explain yourself through the words of those you are explaining to.  This helps in everyday life and in the legal system.  Your arguments are much more sound when you are quoting the other side.    In the legal system (civil), if the defendant's motives are the same as the values of the plaintiff, the judge will more than likely side with the defendant (as long as the actions weren't illegal).  In this case, there is no real reason for me to believe that any laws were broken, so building a defense case around the values of Follett will shorten the length of trial.  Long trials kill off lots of startups ever single year.

This read like an ad
Ah, ok, my misunderstanding of your plugin is now resolved. Thank you
They could go after you for encouraging breach of contract. Talk to a lawyer to see if disclaimers address that.
Can a textbook company force you to purchase it from a specific location? For instance, there was a case where a guy purchased the same book from overseas at a cheaper price and it went to court. The guy sort of lost and sort of won. It cost him all the profit he made defending himself in court (About $100k I think) but he won the case.
why not develop a plug in that links directly to the DL of said book, Yale, Stanford, MIT, and Harvard all have course-ware online for free.  Isn't it time?   It wouldn't be like you uploaded it, just offered the gateway to DL it. 
Seems pretty good, but I cannot seem to get it to work with my universities bookstore: http://books.wou.edu/selecttermdept.aspx  Works on a few other bookstores, seems it may need some work.
I notice you guys don't link to e.g. Library Genesis for $0. Is that for moral reasons, or just legal ones?
Why, just because you tell someone that walking in the street at night is illegal doesn't mean that it is illegal.
I love that "Everything you need to succeed" horseshit.  Yeah, everything except a fat wad of cash.  Anyways, what would you guys do if you actually did get sued over this?

That lot got better, there was a 3rd level of injunction above super injuction that meant it was illegal to even mention the injunction existed to MP's, Solicitors etc. People who would normally be expected to be approached with anything at all.

&gt;if the defendant's motives are the same as the values of the plaintiff, the judge will more than likely side with the defendant   Where are you getting this from?  Judges make decisions based on the law.

You're probably getting a ton of these and in all likelihood you're already doing this, but i want to send this just in case: don't ignore the emails. Don't assume that their lawyers can't do anything. Send them directly to your lawyer and let them give you the advice. You don't want to accidentally miss these. 
I paid for school out of my own pocket too, with a bit of scholarship &amp; financial aid. I know plenty of people don't have a lot of disposable income during the semester. But it's still an expensive luxury that the people who actually *are* among those who have the least could only dream of affording.  "starving student" and "actually starving" are very different things.  
I'd suspect they know their claims have no real merit. Merit doesn't matter all that much if they can use their size and legal budget to intimidate or crush you before you ever get a day in court though. Most businesses will just do whatever costs them the least, even if they are in the right.

"Just to draw an analogy here. They're basically taking a billboard at the side of the road (any website they don't own), and spray painted over it with their own ads." ( /u/chrisms150 )  1. It's unfair competition. 2. It changes the copyrighted content of the web page. (it changes the DOM)  &gt; Or how is this any different from a plugin that just filters out certain sites entirely?  You mean if Amazon made a plugin that would give you 404 if you visited any other bookstore?
When I was in college and still bought books from the bookstore for the very reason you cite (i.e. they control the reading list), at the end of the semester, the book store had a buy-back program.  There was, however, a catch.  They wouldn't show you the price they were willing to pay for each item.  Instead, they would ring up the whole bundle and offer you something.  Honestly, I was eager for beer money so $150 (or whatever it was) sounded good.  It was only later that I noticed on my receipt that several books were bought back at $1 - these being textbooks I bought six months ago for $200 or more.  The next semester during the buyback season I asked why and was told that if the textbook wasn't being used the following semester it was the bookstore's policy to only offer $1 for the book.  I agreed to sell back my books that semester but they told me they weren't allowed to tell me which books were bought back at $1 and those bought at a more competitive price until after the transaction.  I insisted that not be the case and the cashier made an exception for me.  After that, I bought and sold all my textbooks online vowing to never again subject myself to such shady business practices.  My question: is this even legal?  (It does not seem legal to me, but what do I know.)  What other kinds of shady business practices are college book stores known for?
except sometimes they have to ship you the actual code if you buy it online...like it took them a week to send me a notecard with a key written on it.  shit like that is so idiotic

I.e. they're geniuses
I don't really know how much demand there would be though... Maybe Canada, but the 200+dollar text books seem to be a very North-American problem (as far as I've heard).  
My PhD supervisor teaches first year first semester differential equations along with 3rd year mathematical finance, so that would be 72 lectures for the year. Others who teach are similar, but some will only teach a course in their specialisation (so 36 hours or minimum of about 12 if it's a one contact hour a week masters module type course), but some academics don't teach anything, they are just tasked to run problem classes.  They also have to prepare the entire course themselves (for standard courses like calculus, linear algebra, DE's, etc. this just builds on existing material), write the exam, and do all the admin, so teaching more would just be absurd. Better to spread it around.

&gt; We display affiliate links to companies like Amazon, Chegg, and ValoreBooks.  What's very important to remember here is that the *customer* is not paying the affiliate commission, the seller, e.g. Amazon, is. You could argue that Amazon just adds it to the advertised price, but even with that addition it still beats the price offered by many other vendors.  Fun Fact: If you like a particular author (e.g. a novelist) and you want to give them the maximum dollars from your buying their book, go to the *author's website* and click the *Buy it on Amazon* link. In many cases they will make more money from the Amazon affiliate commission than they will in royalties from their publisher.
It's getting to the point where I believe that it should be unethical for an attorney to pursue a low-value, high-Streisand course of action without getting a waiver from their client.   (i.e. a legal action where there aren't really grounds for a suit, or where a suit would have a low chance of success, or against a defendant that's judgement-proof; as compared to an issue where publicity is harmful to the plaintiff and the legal action has a high probability of gaining significant publicity)  "Yes, sir - we can send them a cease-and-desist letter. But you know that we really don't have much in the way of grounds to sue them, and if they go on reddit or other social media sites a threat of legal action will be like free advertising. So if you want to risk their product being heard about by millions of people, please sign here, and here, and here...)

Basically it's a code that allows you to access certain features on the publishers website. It's mainly stuff like example problems, quizzes,  and tests, so now a lot of professors are using it for everything from homework sets to the actual tests. The website grades the work for them so it takes away some of their work.

You can't always get away with it, and yeah STEM fields can be a bit trickier.

We're working on souping up an old DeLorean that might be able to help out for those of us who are too old to benefit at the moment.
They don't need to. The free market economy took care of it pretty well. It seems that it's the only thing that the "hidden hand" does well here.
I'm glad someone noticed that. It can be very situational. You can also have a professor write the book, and essentially just reiterate it during teaching making it rather awful use of class learning.
It's not wanton injection it's user chosen and wanted.  I should be able to inject whatever I want into my browser without any input from anyone.  If I want to be able to compare newegg and tigerdirect to amazon from amazon that should be my prerogative.  I don't see why amazon or anyone should have any say in that or in the original case of books.
I taught my kids to NEVER buy the books before starting the class. Always wait until they found out what books they absolutely had to have.   They turned into proper little misers about buying books, and it probably saved us tens of thousands of dollars. At no point did they have any regret over "Gee, I wish I'd bought that book..."
Not that you care about one person's opinion, but.. I was totally into this until I saw it was connected to "occupy". It's a great idea, I just can't support it.    _____  **EDIT:** -3 ...and this is exactly why: You/your supporters are willing to attempt to censor opinions they don't like.   Yes, downvotes = censorship (which is why there is a need for transparency here)... every time you downvote someone you make it more difficult for them to not be ghost banned in the future.  I have to go around asking mods to get my comments out of the spam filter every time I comment now because I dared ask for evidence while using a new account (which was due to my previous account mysteriously being locked after I demonstrated that I was being brigaded by bots or other users).  ...but I'm sure you won't care until it happens to you.
Considering that the purpose of business is purely to make money, then yeah, it's brilliant to find a way to do that without having to invest in your product. But, there are business practices that we, as consumers, may find undesirable enough that we would want to discourage them.   The problem is that the usual method for consumers to disapprove of business practices is by voting with our dollars. But, when a business is attempting to eliminate that option by eliminating all alternatives, consumers have to find another way to discourage the practice. 
I'm so glad I seemed to have missed the whole "online teaching aide" thing. The stories I hear about these online labs would make me kill myself were I still in school.  Most I had to do was one class had us use some system to turn in papers that could assess originality and find improperly cited sources. Only had to use it once and it ended up not being *that* bad.
This is the most important comment in the thread.
You're entirely missing the point that this is opt-in on the user end.  It's not like they're spray painting over someone else's billboard; rather, they're manufacturing special glasses that someone can put on that can detect when they're looking at the billboard and show them something else.  On (2), I'm no expert on copyright law, but what you're saying goes against all common sense.  If I make a plugin that automatically replaces the word "chicken" with "rhinocerous" on every website, am I violating the copyright of every website talking about chickens?  Less outlandishly, how is this any different from an ad blocker, or any of countless other commonly used extensions that modify the appearance of a website to the liking of the user?  &gt; You mean if Amazon made a plugin that would give you 404 if you visited any other bookstore?  Sure, for instance.  Tons of similar such plugins exist and are widely used without controversy, such as porn filters or "productivity" plugins that block sites that help you procrastinate.
Yeeeeeah, I'm not really advocating the theft of intellectual property or anything. I'm not going to go full blown condemnation on you, because quite frankly I don't care what others do, but yeah.
Do you make money from the plugin (through links or such), and if so, how?
I must have missed something. I could have sworn I learned advanced physics, calculus, and electrical engineering with just books, paper, and a calculator.   Professors should seriously start contributing to online open-source teaching materials. 
 On the subject of the international market, does your extension (or do you have plans to) list prices of older editions or international editions of the same book? Rumor is the, say, Indian version of my book is worth a tiny fraction of my American copy.
Couldn't you avoid all of the above my making the plugin show an icon next to the omnibar that would notify the user somehow instead of showing inline with the page?

If you're teaching in order to pick the pockets of your students, you're not a professor. You're a con artist. 
But the user himself is allowed to inject whatever he wants to in his display. If he wants all amazon product images to be goatse he is free to do so without any legal action being possibly taken against him!If amazon somehow themselves injected those ads it would be illegal. But the user themselves chosing to add information to a webpage itself locally is perfectly fine.
Has Follett officially served you yet?  Have other endpoint content add-ons been adjudicated in court yet? If so what's the legal landscape look like? If not, are you ready to break new legal ground?
Are those similar to those anti-FAPP laws that fundamentalist Christians are proposing? Fondling  And  Pumping  Penis
That Planet Money podcast did a great job of explaining it.   I suggest you also add that many many more publishers are pushing for online textbooks and sites that require a one time code to access homework to make money. I can usually buy my books for under $100 every semester unless some professor requires the $150 online access code for one stinking class.  Oh, and books are expensive to produce to begin with. That's partially a reason for the high price.

Not all Americans are lazy. 
Which makes them geniuses.  I took a Spanish class that used an online homework thing which cost about $150. Homework was only worth 10% of the grade. I had to pay an extra 150 on top of the money the class cost and the book just for 10% of the class. That's genius!!

I don't disagree; when I was in law school, every semester I thought to myself, "I'm getting into the wrong industry. Textbook publishing is where the real money is." 
To use a simpler analogy, browser extensions such as this one don't modify the webpage any more than looking at a billboard through colored glasses defaces the billboard.

Fair enough thought; but myself and other alums who wanna make a difference for the next generation could be convinced to toss $5 their way, I think.

That one's a pretty neat thing to learn. Makes a lot of things make a lot more sense.

Why do corporations sue when they feel that their income is threatened by a 3rd party?  They have no guaranteed "right" or "claim" to income; especially when some of their prices are out of control.  Their "income" is based off of their sales.  If their prices are too high, people will look elsewhere.  How do the big corps not understand this?
How? I'm pro-business in every way. I just don't think starting a project for monetary pursuit deserves a "good on you." The app devs are in this market to make money. There's nothing wrong with that at all and I wish them success with their project.   But I did not intend to reveal any of my views with that statement. I just thought it was funny that the poster provided the most fundamental description of what a business is, as if it were some sort of novel idea.

I specialise in IP/commercial law, although not licensed in the US.  Could we see a copy of the letters/correspondence? Have you received  independent legal advice?  I'd say you are right about their likely angles.   For copyright your main defences would be transformative (fair) use or implied licence. It seems that your extension is only copying data from the page in order to make a comparison. However the problem is that fair use is an affirmative defence to infringement which means you cannot use it to throw out the case before a hearing, which will be expensive.  Breach of contract and/or inducing others to breach contract (terms of service)? The fact is that such terms are difficult to enforce unless the user was forced to agree to them or they were highly prominent. However, if proven you are aware of the terms, this may not help your defence.  Being the US it is pretty easy to find other grounds to sue eg unjust enrichment, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage etc  Here is one of the leading cases on web scraping where eBay managed to get a preliminary injunction: https://www.law.upenn.edu/law619/f2001/week11/bidders_edge.pdf - not exactly on point but similar issues.

Awesome. Using Chrome isn't a problem if it will save me some money haha.   Thanks!
Playing devil's advocate, don't a lot of small, independent booksellers like college book stores require a mark up in order to keep the lights on? How does this extension not punish the mom and pop book shops near college campuses?  Side note: I bought a lot of textbooks off Amazon at a significantly better price than what my local bookstores offered. I went to college in Ann Arbor where a lot of locally owned book stores are closing down, unable to compete with online providers and accordingly, the town has lost some of its character.  Case in point, local staple Shaman Drum Bookstore is now a Five Guys.
Assuming it isnt illegal, are there ramifications of implying it is illegal when it really is not? 
I didn't say it wasn't. I was just trying to point out some semantic humor. It's insane that the word "business" has a negative connotation to many people on here.
While Follett doesn't seem to have any legal ground to stand on, do you fear them dragging you to multiple court cases across the country, trying to use both federal and obscure local laws in attempt to shut you down? Are you prepared for years and years of legal fees if they dump tons of frivolous lawsuits upon you?
[deleted]
They use affiliate links, so they get a % of sale if you buy though their inserted links. This might seem like adware (because it is), but they argue it's beneficial since they are only showing you alternative prices, not forcing ads when there previously were none.  If you get the product for free, you aren't the customer, you are the product.
[deleted]
I think that the parent wanted a bit more: a way to list what things are changed in a custom edition. If it's only the cover, the title, and perhaps the ordering of some chapters, it'd be of use to others as well.
I was only arguing about semantics. Nothing I said revealed my view on business and it's absurd that people are so butthurt about nothing.

Yup, same here, exept with MyMathLab, and I didn't use the textbook at ALL. Im serious not one page. I paid $110 to do my weekly homework that was what...10% of my grade?
YES!!! I remember a course I was in, gen-ed that was on edition 33.  They didn't even just publish every year, they published ever semester saying you needed that version.  It cost $80 of course.  I purchased a 5 version old one for like $5 from a used book store not far from campus and had zero differences from any others the entire semester, even page numbers matched.  Apparently they would do slight grammar fixes or corrections here and there, or on a rare occasion they might add another essay to the book, but it was mostly the same and purely a money grab scam.

Has Follett ever tried to Sue Google for displaying lower prices on textbooks from search results?
I should have elaborated to limit it to physical goods. The services are a whole 'nother story. You're spot on, of course.

There also exist apps on all the app stores that allows you to scan an ISBN number at the bookstore and it brings you a competing online price. They aren't illegal.
Read that as MyMethLab at first.

I'm sure it's probably just to try and scare you.  HA!  One of the colleges I attended wouldn't give Financial Aid refunds until a good 2 months into each semester (too long to go without textbooks) which meant, you either had a to fork up the cash for text books, or you were stuck HAVING to buy books in their bookstore with your financial aid.  It was such a freakin crap pot.  They made out like bandits though.

No, they cannot. You can buy whatever book you want.  The case you metioned I'm assuming is the one that went to the supreme court. It said that the first-sale doctrine applies even if the book was printed or sold outside of the US.  So, he may have lost with the legal fees, but he won for all of us by setting that precedent. (I'm pretty sure he got legal fee help because many companies / associations were on his side).   
Sounds a lot like a Dalek to me. 
I think a lot of companies gave played to be on Adblock's whitelist.

Well good thing you now have the Reddit Army to do some good ol' guerrilla marketing for you! 
What if they respond by updating textbooks more often? Used books will be less useful as they will not match the current books used in classes. Everyone loses.   The current model (before this app) works pretty well. Many students who can afford it pay full price for the new books. Poorer students look up the same book on an external used book website. Everyone wins?
It more than likely is but my mind at the time was more focused on the fact that I could buy 10% of my grade for $40.  If the book was $200+ I would have been pissed.

May I inquire you what it means ???
These codes allow access to automated homework-grading systems. So if you don't by the code, you effectively can't do homework for the class.
Can you just share with friends? Or do you have to submit the homework online using an account as well?
Nobody has a right to make money, except people making stupid apps and plugins.
If I have learned anything from watching the RIAA, MPAA, and other patent trolls over the years... I have learned that, yes, they will try to sue the end user.    These people don't care.   If they did then they would not charge 300 dollars for a chemistry lab manual that cost them .30 cents to produce.  They have made a living off of the exploitation of our poorest citizens: children trying to get an education.    If anything, i'm surprised that they have not filed *more* suits given the character that they have displayed over the years.        
I was wondering when will support be added for North Carolina State University, or NC State Bookstores? I tried using your extension there with no luck.
Do you plan on making this for Firefox in the future?

Correcting people where it counts.  You're the best around.

Because they're participating in the fraud.
no it wouldn't. I bought the three components for my computer class this past semester for $110. 90 for the access code and 10 for each book. The bookstore was offering it for 235 dollars.
I've only had to take basic college algebra so I have no clue about the higher level maths. I'm sure they are as much of a rip off and still use crappy programs. They really try to convince you that you need new mathbooks. "Guys we were wrong in edition (8) we wrote [2+2=4] as question #1, it was suppose to be question #3   TIME FOR A NEW $300 EDITION FEED ME YOUR DEBT OMNONOM!
Have you considered creating a Safari extension to go along with the Chrome plugin? Would it be difficult to port the extension to Safari? I figure both browsers would use the same JavaScript code base for their extensions but I'm not sure. 
I would think it depends who initiated the idea. If someone came to a lawyer and suggested it, it seems fair enough retribution for the fucks who try to abuse the legal system and everyone's time and money.
But if it comes down to an argument, they can use your words and say, "even here, you implied that you yourself believed it to be illegal."  You don't want to even suggest the possibility that the idea ever even crossed your mind that you might be doing something wrong.
Have an upvote for being an awesome professor. I've graduated awhile ago, but every professor who makes school more accessible to those who have limited funds is doing a good thing
Agree 100%, let the lawyer do the talking...however it still could be a good idea to include such a description on the plugin itself when a user goes to install it.
[deleted]
Just because they don't have a right to income doesn't mean that they shouldn't pursue income. If you are running a doomed business (say oil), are you going to just give up on millions of barrels that haven't yet been sold, or pack up everything and move straight to solar and wind. Yeah, the corporations may act like dicks, but it's not like the don't understand basic econ.
For the record, that quote of mine came from when a post about how comcast (and other ISPs) were injecting ads into sites you were visiting. It had nothing to do with a user installing a plugin to do something. 
&gt;Now we are paying hundreds of extra dollars for the ability to do work and earn grades.  That is the worst part, it would be a tad more reasonable (just a tad) if this wasn't on top of insanely expensive college tuition. And that tuition (or rather the degree) is basically required to do well job wise.

Moneys. Likely funneling the userbase to third (paying) parties.
My professor this year raffled his copy of the book away and posted a pdf of the last edition for the rest of use. One of my favourite professors in college. 
Does does saying that imply you think it's illegal? Maybe you just want to take it down because of the hassle it'd cause otherwise.
This is negated by the fact that even in books that update once every two years, a lot of their facts remain ten or more years out of date, either by oversight or laziness. Oftentimes the updates will be nothing more than fluff while things that need major changes remain untouched.
[deleted]
It doesn't help Follett and friends that they act like they have a monopoly when they don't. The market has changed with online shopping killing geography-based monopolies.
Do people even use safari???  That is like using IE.  
Same as you, I go to community college(which I would recomend to everyone if a local college offers something you are interested in, I spend $1600 for about 4 classes a semester)  I NEVER get from the bookstore I always get from amazon and then trade the books back for credit, then use the credit to buy next semesters books. It's a pretty great system and usually I have enough on returns to buy more books and essentially just keep recycling the same money.  Edit:words
&gt;We do have a lawyer, but I think that going to court against a behemoth like Follett would be prohibitively expensive for just about any company of our size.  Couldn't you counter-sue for at least legal costs on the grounds of something like Free Speech to provide alternatives to end-users? It seems like you could argue a hypothetical like you were handing out fliers outside a business at the mall for a similar business and letting customers decide. 
[deleted]
What a total brofessor.
That's not completely fair: the online components occasionally are actually a value add. Granted, it's very often just the scheme you describe, shifting the problem sets online to extract money from the used market. But there is some value to getting instant feedback on problem sets, while other online versions offer a guided reading mode that (among other things) makes it easier for profs to verify whether or not students actually did the reading.   Of course, I agree that the price is exorbitant and often there's minimal value add for students. But they're not as evil as many of the comments below suggest.
I don't think they can take any legal action? Your extension modifies the page content on the client side, and doesn't "distribute" any copyrighted content of any kind. I think you're in the clear, or every single browser extension ever would be illegal.
That has nothing to do with drowning someone out in legal expenses.  In the U.K. and many other commonwealth countries, like Canada, the loser pays the winner a certain percentage of the legal fees associated with litigation.  That percentage is based on factors such as merit and willingness of parties to settle the matter.  In frivolous cases the award can be on a full indemnity basis, meaning 100% of the costs must be repaid.  Other times it's a substantial indemnity basis, meaning 70-90% of the costs are repaid, and otherwise it's a partial indemnity basis where 50-70% of the cost is repaid.  In some cases, where neither side offered to settle, and both sides had very compelling arguments, it's also possible that a judge will not have to require the loser to pay.
Yes.

I am in agreement, but look at the percentage of "faculty" at most universities who are adjuncts. In the class I teach, I could double my salary by selling each student a $150 text.

[deleted]
Why are text books even that expensive? Pure greed?
Because it's the free version of Avast!, and this is how they decided to monetize it. Since they already built it to scan web pages you open (to defend against malware), they figured the might as well add in a few extra bits to earn some money by generating affiliate links when relevant.
I wanted to add that my alma mater, University of Missouri, has other prices (Amazon, half.com,etc) listed on their bookstore website. At least some colleges and universities are trying to help students price books.  Have you noticed other colleges and universities providing this price comparison service?  I still find it frustrating that instead of having a non-bookstore booklist (besides the course syllabus), most colleges organize their required books through the bookstore.
The student loan factor is huge. Also some scholarships will pay for books no matter what the cost as long as it's books (in some cases easier to get covered for expensive campus bookstores vs. used online). This is even worse than consumers not knowing about cheaper options: it's no cost to them, so may as well go with the easy, "official" source. It's a huge racket. I remember in graduate school, about 1998 thinking "finally!  eBay (half.com) will take down the textbook racket! Yay!" 2015 and boy was I wrong. Professors could help the situation by asking students to use the prior versions of textbooks. But from what I've seen, they blithely require what the campus bookstores will offer, which is always the nth edition: higher-priced with new mistakes.
&gt; sooooo much wrong in higher education  And unfortunately even though for a lot of fields you can learn a ton (even as much as a degree, for example MIT's free online lectures) outside of higher education, you won't get that piece of paper with an effective value of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

What a bunch of complete wankers.
I got a $178 math book off amazon, because I thought it had mymathlab access, nope! Now I need to spend $90 for an access code too. the publisher also sells the "solutions book" for about $37 which has all odd numbered math problems worked out as well as chapter tests. I remember being in middle/high school and our math textbooks having those answers in the back. It seems now that the publishers broke that part off the book, just so they could sell it separately. I swear college book publishers are right up there with Monsanto and comcast in terms of praying on students and the CEO's bathing in goats blood to make them strong and grant them eternal life.
I realize this is going to be buried, but you might want to seek out the guy that was being sued for finding cheaper flights. [Skiplagged](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2o831k/i_run_skiplagged_a_site_being_sued_by_united/). He might have some good advice.
Only on subsidised Stafford loans. 
So many of my former colleagues hammering students with online "features." And they don't even get a cut! Shamefully disinterested in the situation.
One of my buddies told me he had a prof that said "this is the book you are suppose to get, I wrote it and get some money when you buy it. There are also editions in the library you can use if you don't want to buy anything" sounds like a cool dude.
PC games are generally pretty good about that kind of thing. Largely because there is no used game market, but the steam sales are even cheaper than used games. Plus there are a ton of free games that are hella fun like TF2 and League, or games that are cheap and hella fun, like CS:GO and TDU.

Were I a lawyer (I'm not) for a truck driving operation (Not involved in that either) I would still recommend a sign saying "Keep Back, The operator of this truck is not responsible for rock damage", because it would encourage drivers to KEEP BACK, thus reducing the liability of damage from rocks, by reducing the number of incidents. It would also reduce the number of people who actually call in to complain about rock damage.

Does it work with Canadian Bookstores???  
What really pisses me off about those is how easy it would be to circumvent. Hire some grad students to make some problem sets and use pretty much any free quiz-making software out there online. Hell, develop it in-house since it's a pretty damn simple things to develop. It'll cost one time and then can be open to all the students at the school forever (or until the material changes which is very unlikely in a lot of fields' undergrad stuff).

Well, in theory, lawyers are supposed to protect clients from themselves. I mean if a murder defendant said "I'm just going to go to the Prosecutor and tell him I killed those ten people and what's he gonna do about it" the attorney can't *stop* her, but should certainly advise against it.

You could certainly see it that way, but I would just say it's proper business sense to want to get paid for the product your customer is using.
This was a huge inspiration for us to post!  I'll try and get in contact.
That's the publisher's doing, and it drives both the bookstore and the used textbook sellers nuts. 
I mean, the writers, editors, and publishers need some money to survive and continue doing what they do (just no where near as much as they demand). Plus pirating is illegal and frowned upon.
not necessarily but in court.. I think there might be an issue with admitting some sort of fault.  Best to reply "Well thats like.. your opinion man"
I know that in my university, lab textbooks are used to pay for materials, whether that be cadavers or chemicals. Shitty that it has to happen like that, but it also isn't really fair to make some French or Drama major pay more in their tuitions so that the chemistry department can afford acetone and cyclohexane.
I'm so pleased to read this comment, what a sterling offer of help. I hope OP responds.    Edit: Yay
So I guess you give zero shits about content creators. ~~Also I disagree with you on Steam being scummy, besides their customer support Steam is fucking awesome.~~ EDIT: nvm  I agree that textbook producers are being dickheads, but I don't want them all to starve or change fields.

That's terrible. I also had a college professor who wrote the course textbook, but he actually gave everyone a free copy (albeit printed out, not an actual retail book). Said the school was against it.  Crazy when professors have to pirate their own book in the name of education.
Anyone have to use ALEKS for chem or any other class?  That was literally the worst.
I never said steam was scummy.   
Wow.  I didn't realize how awesome my O-Chem profs were.  The text was co-written by my O-Chem 1 &amp; 2 professors (and two others from different universities).  The book was required.  The new edition came out a year later by the time I was able to take #2.  The professor said it was fine to use the older edition and even posted study and HW questions for both editions on the class web page.  Saved me a lot of money.
Capitalism has devolved into the worst version of itself. Instead of competition it's legal warfare.

At my school all three semesters of Calc use some edition of Stewart's calculus text. It hasn't changed in years. Linear Algebra is supposed to move up to a new edition next year, but it hasn't changed too much. Other standard courses (Abstract, Analysis, Combinatorics, etc.) use pretty standard ~150 dollar texts. We have a few classes like Experimental Mathematics and a sort of Intro to Proofs that use $30 texts that are written more like normal books. The standard classes books are older and thus easier to find used for cheap, and the cheaper books are usually pretty close to new but aren't a huge burden anyhow.
Because they can be- it helps them squeeze more money out of the people who still buy/rent used books.  The textbook market is a verifiable clusterfuck, a perfect example of cronyism.
So this is actually a thing? Is it on US only or Europe too? Been doing college in SA and never needed to buy any books. All content is provided for free by teachers in the uni's moodle, or they will just say a books name and you go get it somewhere/read it on the library, at the very least teachers will recommend you copy an actual book from the library (fair use for educational purposes, I guess?) but even this is very rare and optional. Also, editions are rarely updated, only when really needed.
That was beautiful. My up votes are your up votes.  
That and "Guys we're not printing edition 8 anymore and we're buying up the used stocks, so if you want your whole class to have a copy you best get the new edition."
Because he wants to make referral money.  
Couldn't they also sue you for wrongful interference in a business contract/ relationship or something like that? I feel that, like Copyright and ToS, it's a fairly weak argument as well. Dunno off the top of my head if there's any court cases.  Source: just took Business law, did not buy textbook
Does the plugin require an ISBN? I'm trying to use it on my campus bookstore website but it's not recognizing any books. There is no ISBN listed on the page.
Especially when there's some bullshit like when Chem 100's $60 for the code, but 101's $120 for the code.
To be fair, representing 5 sig figs when you have 2 or something is fairly wrong.
Follett employee here, can confirm that they are a shite company and it is no surprise that they have their panties in an uproar over the potential loss of profit. Their claims appear baseless, I hope your endeavor is successful. 
It is completely legal.
Why not
I've seen a lot of this in college as well. I started noticing that publishers wouldn't change any real content but rather change all the odd numbered exercises at the end of the chapter. One of my engineering books was bold enough to use the exercises from the same book just a few editions back. 
Of course, that doesn't stop them from publishing new books anyway- half the books I've needed were published in the year the class was for- my German textbook has both an access code, and was published in mid-2014.    [edit] Oh, and I forgot to mention, it's nearly impossible to find in a properly bound, or hardback format- good luck reselling an unbound book.
That's definitely a long-term feature we'd love to build.  We pull up "alternate" editions on Texts.com, but a "change log" between editions (past and custom) would be absolutely awesome.  We've brainstormed ways to crowdsource this and hope to come up with something down the road.
Aren't textbooks outside of the US hilariously (or rather, tear-inducingly) cheap though?
WCGW?
Completely unethical, and a very similar situation happened to me at the University of Arizona during my undergrad.  Many universities actually have ethics rules in place so that a professor cannot mandate their own book to be sold.  Clearly not all of em do.
Depending how the codes are generated, you could do that, in theory. That's where the school collusion comes back into play - if they suspect fraudulent codes were used to register for a given class, they could audit the students taking it and make them prove they bought a code legitimately by providing a receipt or such.   Game publishers don't know who is buying their games, so even if they catch you bypassing their DRM the worst they can do is retaliate against whatever online profile you used the fraudulent key with. Universities have full information on who is enrolled in every class, and can easily link a fraudulent code to the identity of the student who used it, and then the consequences could involve legal action or even expulsion from the school (and the black mark on your record that comes with that).   The code system itself is nothing new. But with the schools actively supporting it and participating in it, it becomes harder to bypass. It would be like if you had to tie your steam account to your social security number, and then valve put black marks on your credit report if they catch you pirating a game.  So given the potential consequences, even if the codes themselves could be generated or stolen, would *you* risk your academic and financial future just to save a few hundred dollars in the short term?  And the more fraudulent codes you use, the greater your risk of discovery - so the more money this saves you, the more likely it'll blow up in your face and get you kicked out of school entirely.   The best way around this system is to fight it and prevent it from becoming widespread *now*. With the teachers and schools on board with it, once it's entrenched it will be incredibly difficult to avoid it. 
Oh man you're bringing back memories of that shit. My jimmies are getting right rustled.
&gt; free market economy  We were talking about the USA, I think, not some utopian Radian fantasy society. 
Sorry, it was meant as more of a rhetorical, thinking out loud question.  Gas Buddy is just a nationwide database of gas stations where users update the current price of gas when they fill up somewhere.  Basically it's just giving you another set of eyes to watch prices with and building a pricing map. Your plugin is the exact same thing at its core.  I just can't see how they have a leg to stand on trying to shut you down.  Consumers have a right to know and it would be a tragedy for free market if a court tried to shut you down.
Physical goods.. like textbooks?  Forget what thread you're in?

So basically you pay extra for the prof to do less work?
Being a hypocrite isn't illegal and I don't think there are civil codes against it anywhere either.  
Mind shooting us an email to admin@texts.com?  We should be able to grab it even if it's not listed visibly.  You can also always pate in an ISBN to Texts.com/b/ISBN_HERE and it'll pull up the cheapest prices directly.
I'm a college math professor and have moved to an open source Calculus text, free to download. The problem is the lack of problem sets with solutions, but my dept is writing our own.

But you often only need less than half of them. I always avoid optional textbooks as they are never used.
yea but needing 2 but put 3? or need 1 but put 2? it literally makes no significant difference. It gives very little margin for error which makes people lose points that they may need AND leads them to the wrong answer/rethink the entire thing that they got right (since it doesn't even tell you where you got the answer wrong). Every time that happened, i always found myself going "But I did everything right! What's wrong with my math? did I use the right equations? I followed the last problem exactly like this and was right!" And I inevitably end up Google searching for the answer anyway. Second guessing yourself is not a good habit to get into. 
Particularly if it's a fairly prestigious school.
This often isn't possible, especially with required core classes. For example all of the Chemistry I and II classes at my college require purchase of an access code for a site called ALEKS.
Like Pearson?
[deleted]
Sounds like your prof was a professional dbag. Just remember to write off your school expenses when tax time come around. Most if not all additional expenses can come back to you as a tax credit (depending on many variables of course). Keep those receipts or make every purchase with the same credit card so they are easy to find.
It's also important that the need for this plugin is different from country to country. I'm fairly certain we don't need it in Germany but this might have been my university only. I bought a few books but not because I had to (except for a cheap one for a language course). I can get most books we need at the university library.
Obviously this is only one example, but I know a guy who graduated from the second highest ranked university in the country, and is incredibly intelligent, but became a truck driver as a stop gap job. ~20 years on he was basically unemployable for higher level jobs because his previous work was all trucking.
You COULD say that, but last year the government made about 40Billion in profit on student loan repayments.  This is not just revenue paid back, this is actual government PROFIT off the student loan industry, or I should say, tax-payer backed loans.  A lot of people don't realize that these non-subsidized government student loans are TERRIBLE interest rates on a 10-20 year payback cycle.  The government is projected by 2020 to be profiting over 100 Billion p/year on the student loans.  They are making insane profit even with something like 20% of student loans currently in default.  Since we all know how the government is when it comes to money, this is a new golden goose of revenue and I don't think they are gonna make that go away anytime soon.  Reality is the only people hurting from these loans are students, imo.
Have you bothered to obtain legal advice from a lawyer on whether what you are doing is legal?

You were talking about their DRM aspect as though they were scummy. Or are you saying that they are good as you would pirate otherwise, due to your lack of morals.

When I was buying textbooks (not long ago at all) I just went to the university bookstore, copied the ISBNs of all my books, and then googled then to find the lowest price. I thought that was easy. This is easier, and that's cool. I just feel bad for those who bought textbooks before computerization. Wtf was that like, seriously? You go in with a list of books and they pull them for you, and you have to pay whatever they ask? Fuck that.

Oh god, the first time I was on a jury was for the conviction of a sovereign citizen. He didn't use a lawyer and was going off on tangents about how the NSA was spying on us. His whole case was based on his defense that he was a sovereign citizen and our laws didn't apply to him because of that.
&gt; As a result, they raise prices to try and maintain profits which leads to a positive feedback of spiraling prices.  Won't this ultimately collapse their part of the system they're trying to survive in?
As an older student,  I had no idea about PB and their ilk.  Coughing up that much money for a book that I would use once opened me up to the idea of pirating anything for the first time.  Except for VHS movies.   Been doing that since the 80s.
This is great! Have any of the schools said anything about it? I don't know if those bookstores are owned by the school or if they receive a lot of money from these stores but when I was in school even the professors thought the books prices were ridiculous at the bookstore, so they would tell us to buy it for cheap elsewhere. Some professors even provided assignments to match the different versions which made it even cheaper! Others provided us with copies of the chapters we needed!

It's interesting to get a professor's perspective on this.  I know one of the big pushes among publishers, as you mentioned in a separate comment, is to move towards digital homework solutions and adaptive learning (MyMathLab, Connect, WebAssign, etc.), typically sold through one-semester access codes.  As an instructor, do you think transitioning publishers to selling this type of solution (rather than textbooks/ebooks), would ultimately be a good thing for students and higher education, a bad thing, or neutral?
[deleted]
Yeah, I had a professor write his own "textbook" which was only published on CDs. In other words, he could have just sent the info to us. But instead, he had about 1200 students a year buying his $30 CD from the campus bookstore- the only place that carried it. Ignoring the horrible grammar and spelling, embedded at random into the assigned reading were things like "exactly 17 minutes after class starts, stand up quietly and say nothing" If you did so, you got a hundred for the day, everyone else failed. Not to mention half the text was his opinion, or even personal anecdotes which we would later be tested on.

Done. Thanks for the help.
On what ground is Follett sueing you, and how are you refuting said arguments??  (Sorry if asked MANY times before, I have a passion for law, and I love building cases for and against someone given the law.)
Yep, people are crazy.
Yeah but everything was cheaper back then. Education costs have inflated tremendously over the last few decades. 
*M'gistrate.*
Your comment sent me to do a bit of research, and it turns out my understanding of stu loans was a little outdated. I thought that federal student loans were just guaranteed by the govt and that banks were doing the lending - it turns out this was actually changed in 2010, and these profits the gov't are expected to make are essentially just profits that the banks were making before the change. So thats a good thing! Also, hopefully since it is the Govt that's making this money then massive student loan amnesty is possible - whereas if it was the banks doing the lending the public would be tricked into thinking the banks are getting screwed by stu lo amnesty.

I'm sure an egg beater/rice cooker combo is sold in Japan.
Well I've been out of school long enough that I never had these online homework things, but if you ask me they should have a long form text box, 1,000 character limit, and accept whatever you put in them.  And yes, I lost points if I fucked up sig figs.  It most certainly makes a difference.  Like super especially for chemistry - that's the discipline where having a little bit too much of a chemical can lead to it not completely reacting, which is really, really bad sometimes.  There is especially where 0.50 and 0.5 are very, very different concepts.

Oh ya, I agree the gov't handling the loans is a MUCH better deal.  I don't think we'll ever see a massive amnesty though.  I guess I am just cynical lol.
My professors would always recommend the old versions since they were literally the same just moved around slightly

&gt; Right. Everyone pointed to e-books and other paperless products as the beginning of the end for textbook companies  They still are.  The paid content can also be made available online for free.  It *was* available for free when professors actually came up with their own coursework.  It just seems that universities have to go down with them.  Which is starting to happen with things such as fully accredited, free online universities.

The textbooks industry in America is totally fucked. Between colleges doing their extortion routine and McGraw hill and Pearson, the two major publishers in primary school. Pearson also owns the rights to either the ACT or the SAT - our two standardized graduation tests. (If you continue your education past grade 12 at least)    If you want to learn more- check into how state boards choose books. Most copy Texas or California's book of choice. It's a rabbit hole of near anti trust and WTF REALLY but it sheds a lot of light on my early education and why things were the way they were.   IE our middle school science book at a public school "taught the controversy" by tearing down darwins scientific methods and presented Genisis as an "opposing view point". We got our books from texas.   Edit: speelling

How much research was done when deciding which secondary booksellers were reputable enough to be included in your search index? For example, the cheapest rates I found on many of my books for the coming semester were from "abebooks.com," but when I researched their reputation, I  found a long lists of complaints and warnings not to buy from them. Of course, I completely understand that you can't assume liability for each and every distributor.

Not at all, this is capitalistic for-profit education. There is a reason why the richest Professor at my university drives a Mazarriti; He sells a shrink wrapped textbook which he wrote, every year with an access code(that is needed to take required quizes) that cost 300 dollars to his students. He has about 400 students each semester. All 400 students have to buy his text book thats 120,000 dollars of revenue per semester. I am guessing he probably takes in in around 6 figures in textbook royalties a year. Not saying its right. Definitely legal though.

Why wasn't this in my life earlier.
We actually vet all of our affiliates to ensure that they're quality / reputable companies.  I have personally used AbeBooks without issue, and I know that the site is owned by Amazon.  AbeBooks sources a lot of their books from international retailers, people who buy books in bulk (sometimes very old, or damaged, etc.), which is why there might be complaints.  To AbeBooks' credit, I have always seen the conditions prominently / transparently displayed.

I haven't bought any textbooks, except for a spanish textbook used for Spanish 101-202, for the last 3 semesters.  Most of the time I find we don't even use it, or at least not in a meaningful way that justifies several hundred dollars being spent.  Is this normal or is my university just shitty?

i find it interesting they sent you an email concerning a legal issue BEFORE they 'involve their legal team'. eh????
Whooopse do. Let's go back and see what sparked this "discussion": &gt; In the UK a lot of shops say something like "no returns (does not affect statutory rights)".  I don't know where frankster lives, but if there's one thing that the free market economy did well in the U.S., it's the competition that led to ultra-liberal return policies, unmatched pretty much elsewhere in the world. That's what I was alluding to - obviously too stealthily. I hereby apologize for the stealthiness. I was hoping that everyone who talks about the U.S. in terms of product returns, knows what they are talking about. TIL: apparently not.
you say 'they could try...' but if you have already received legal threats, did these threats not specify a ground? That'd be pretty unusual.
http://www.follettofcanada.ca/ lists all of the stores Follett runs in canada. a majority of them, when run by the university, were poorly run money pits for the shcool, Follett comes in, offers to run them for a guaranteed profit for the school and the school leases them the rights to operate the store. 
Tenure! 
In my opinion, this only creates a bad feedback loop for the publishers. Because the higher the price of a new textbook, the fewer students can afford it. This opens up a niche on the market with huge demand for cheaper used textbooks. So basically they are trying to fight the used textbook market by feeding it demand. Which drives any market up. 
There has to be a Redditor with a 194 IQ, And the particular set of skills to make these lawyers back off. :P 
You said there you're only modifying the end-user's experience with their permission. Whilst right, I think it could be better phrased that you're modifying the end-users experience on the end-user's demand!      With emphasis on the 'demand'.

For real life science, sure sig figs can be both good or bad. But for a physics homework problem it really shouldn't make you lose all your credit because you were off by .03 units. Just a little more flexibility answer wise instead of "Only this answer is accepted" would be nice for students.

Follett's wholesale group sells used textbooks to mom and pop stores too. 
Mostly to access homework assignments or quizzes. Therefore if you don't have the code, you automatically get a zero for that portion of your grade
Not disagreeing with any of your points, but surely an important one is that they can have a very specialist audience. It's not like a novel where any old Joe may pick it up, some advanced book looking at a niche area of academia will only have diddly amount of people who would be interested and it needs a very high level of expertise to write+edit. To make the publishing financially viable for the parties involved, don't they need to set the cost high?
Uhhh.. do not buy books either. Just rent. I've never paid over $40 to rent a book for a semester.
I've posted this before, but I used to be the evil monkey behind the computer helping to facilitate the custom book creation.  There is never any info in a custom book that is unique to your class, unless your professor created it themselves. Most of the time it was either the entire book without a couple of chapters OR just the entire book with a different binding.  Want to check? Open the book to the copyright page, and it will say every main ISBN it pulls the content from. Just buy that book instead. 
Zero credit?  Hell no.  Partial credit?  Yep.  Of course the computer shouldn't grade anything.  If a computer can understand it completely, you have no need to.  Show your work, partial credit. Anything else is an incompetent teacher.
Thats fantastic. Hopefully more professors will follow in your lead. Maybe someday educators can make a site with everything students need for the their classes that was free, like an opensource "Education wiki site or something.
&gt; Shut up about it.  Never, ever respond to legal intimidation and bullying by being quiet about it. If you're in the right and they're trying to push you around, let *everyone* know.  Just don't say anything untrue.

We did it, reddit!
So I used to make the custom books for a major publicly traded textbook company here in the states. Our books usually were just the regular book in a different binding or a book without a chapter in there. Most of the time we didn't even repaginate, so there would be huge gaps of pages missing. Either way, the copyright page had to list what main ISBNs the content was pulled from (like, Astronomy Student Edition Volume 3).   Any way to have a user submittal where they say "this custom book exists and it pulls from this text". Obviously it'd be buy at your own risk, but it would help the students know what books to look at if they want to be on the wild side.  I can't applaud you guys enough for this. After leaving that job I felt dirty for months. 
This is great as I'll be going to college next year, so thanks a ton for this. I am also interested in developing something which finds lower prices on various objects, but I don't know enough yet (I plan on studying Computer Science in college).   My question is, is it difficult to fetch prices from all over the web? Or is it only a few blocks of code?

Funny story: I worked for Follett in college and got a discount on all their textbooks.  I still never used it because their prices were still outrageous. 
Blame your professor or department.  The sales people talk the professors into ordering them. The worst is when they get a royalty kickback on any custom content put in the book. Like, in exchange for putting the syllabus on the front page of the loose leaf packet, they get $5 per book. 
Occupy...that's cute.  You realize money is still going to those companies, right?
there are maybe 2 industries in the united states that are more evil than United States ISPs, congratulations on finding and fighting one of them.   How do you plan to make every college student aware of the resources you have given them?
You do understand Follett is not a book publisher right? They just sell the books and are not allowed to charge over 20% margins on them.
Don't worry about students donating.  Target people like me, the parents of students.  Wish you'd been around for the past 7 years (I've put two through) and while Amazon used to be a good deal, it's been less so since they started "renting" the books.

Wow, I can't even wrap my head around the idea that professors just take assignments from books. At my University the assignments are made by the professor or an assistant.
I just go pick the book at my college library, never had to buy a textbook. Why is that not the case in America?
Coercion is as old society itself, does not require any real critical thinking, and using it certainly does not make someone a genius.

They give partial credit if you get the right answer within a certain number of tries. But once your tries are up, you lose all the points and the software gives you the answer without any explanation/work. I guess the good news is that then you can go review the "hints", but like I said previously, those can sometimes be more confusing than helpful. It's a really bad homework system, but they instituted it because then they don't have to hire graders/homework checkers.

It's perfectly "legal", as far as I can tell.  Shady as fuck?  Yes.  Possibly will cause a program that requires the course (or allows it to fulfill requirements) to lose accreditation?  Of course.  Illegal?  I can't see why.  Caveat Emptor.
website can be considered store fronts, so if this guy had his own site aggregating the best prices no problem, if he uses their website and puts his one extension on top of it that's where he'll get in trouble. I'm not saying it's right, I'm just saying that Follett will be able to successfully sue these guys
Ate you kidding me?  I know a professor who does this, but it's only $20
The subject had literally no recourse.  Can't discus it with anybody - so how do you challenge it.  And it's not even like there's an issue of national security here.  Plus of course we have no idea what else is covered up by these.  Democracy in action.  
You said, "*we* are modifying the web page... ."  You are NOT modifying a web page.  The *end user* is modifying the web page by using the extension that they chose to use.  It's a fine distinction, but their lawyers will use your statement the way you wrote it against you.  I know that's what you eventually said, but they'll just take the parts that help their argument.

For a follow-up plugin would you consider notifying people of books that have been mangled by the Texas schoolboard and suggest alternatives?

This is horrifying. I'm in the UK and none of my friends at various universities here have experienced this. How can anyone possibly justify it? Hope your school stops doing this soon, really sucks! Is it true for the very wealthy schools like Harvard and MIT? 
You're absolutely right about them having "group think." My dad used to sometimes listen to "Dale the trucking bozo" (or whatever his name is) and a couple similar ones on Sirius. They're as rightwing as Rush Limbaugh (sp?), and are apparently quite popular with truckers.

I just tried at my school's website, which now uses Barnes &amp; Noble, and the plugin doesn't work. Or at least, nothing is popping up onscreen when I add the books to my cart. Is there something I need to do to activate the extension or should it just pop up?
Ithink it's neither and they are an active partner in screwing you. They consider you're experience and have decided to make it expensive and unpleasant.

Funny thing is that I'm from Sweden, living in a location with lots of truckers and other workers. It's the same kind of groupthink here, but most people are socialists (that runs deep in the Swedish workers' mindset). Not that I've got much against socialism per se. It's just fun to note that the particular political platform they prefer can differ that much.  In Sweden it's kind of possible to be both conservative and socialist at the same time, and there's where I would put the typical trucker. They don't appreciate the progressiveness of the socialist party, especially not regarding European policies, but they absolutely despise the conservatives.
Hey, are you the same peaches017 who owned LL.org from namepros before? ^_^
nice, will you develop a version for other countries (maybe germany :D)?
lol, you cant be serious.  
Are you being stealthily sarcastic here? I thought it was pretty common knowledge that the USA has terrible consumer protection laws compared to the UK and EU countries. In EU countries, for example, there's a [guaranteed full two year minimum warranty](http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/shopping/shopping-abroad/guarantees/index_en.htm) on virtually everything. Even on high ticket consumer items in the USA, in my experience, most things only have a one year limited warranty.
I was just thinking of Honey and looking at it in the corner of Chrome the whole time reading this thread. It's ridiculous that someone would claim a legal recourse to stop a web browser addon from adding on to the web. Once their website is on your browser, it's data in your computer. Of course your computer should be allowed to read the price and run an simple check against other prices (and in the case of Honey, check for available coupons).

I would think as long as the user is made aware of what the browser is doing, it shouldn't be a problem. Someone could release a browser that changes every instance of the word "God" to "The Flying Spaghetti Monster". If it did it without making it obvious to the user, I think it would be a huge problem.

Thats true and all, but most profs, at least from my exp in STEM classes, don't force students to buy books. So, if you need it for the knowledge, then an older edition is encouraged half the time, if available. They have to be subtle in how they encourage it, because even they are restricted on what they can say.   Some of my profs actually told us that while there is a textbook, all hwk and exams will be based on his lectures and resources, so the book is useless, but he cannot tell us that we don't need to buy it.
How are you guys dealing with the recent trend of a website account being included with each book sale, and some instructors requiring them be purchased because they are using that system for their class?
No there isn't, you're just talking out of your ass.

Well, yes and no.   You can't detect browser plugins from the server's end necessarily. You can respond to adblock *on the client's browser* by checking if there's a plugin removing a certain HTML element from the webpage, but that's all client-side code and can be edited by the user. That is, once the server sends off the webpage, they have no way of knowing if it was modified by the browser unless the browser chooses to tell them. Some people also just put a message behind the Ad on their webpage, so that if it's removed you're left with the message asking you to turn off adblocking.  In this case the plugin is just adding stuff to the webpage. If they (Follet or the other bookstores) wanted to "block" you using the plugin they could send code with their page to detect those elements being added and respond in whatever fashion.   Hopefully you can see that at that point it's just a cat and mouse game. The plugin could be modified to disable the relevant code from the website doing the blocking. The website could modify its code to break that functionality. The plugin could update itself again to respond to the new code. It's really fruitless and unenforceable to try and do.
Hell, you could even sue Web browsers for reproducing copyrighted content
Always worth mentioning. I got gold for doing so once.

&gt;Just the mere action of putting up such a sign (like the "we are not responsible if a rock falls off" sign) should be illegal.  Yes, but freedom of speech...  You can't outlaw bullshit, otherwise churches and Hollywood would be out of business...
The warranties are indeed cool, but Europe is truly atrocious when it comes to *returns*. As in: I bought something, but either changed my mind, or got too much, or got it to try it out and decided it doesn't work as well as I wanted to, etc. The return period is between 30 and 90 days in most places, sometimes longer. On balance I think that I'd rather have easy returns than universal 2 year warranty. But that's me.  Given that very, very few things that I get truly break, I don't care much for warranty on most items. But sure as heck I like occasionally to buy lots of stuff, try it all out, and then return what doesn't work for me, for whatever reason, without having to explain myself much if at all.
Did someone say they wanted an [invocation of a Sterling offer to help?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x6KApzgtjU#t=174)  Too bad... that's the best I could do. 
"As a law student" doesn't hold any value when you're not even from the same country.
Wow, these assholes have the nerve to charge broke kids insanely overpriced amounts for books and now they're suing you?
You can (and should) outlaw wrongful legal claims though. When someone outright claims they dont have legal responsibility for something, when the law actually says they do, then giving that false and misleading information should be illegal. I know it would be here.

Did you take a look at the case of Facebook denying access to users with Yontoo extensions installed? Yontoo had massive layoffs from very simple logic that FB implemented. Then it spilled over to the legal system.  Long story short OP... If they want you off of their site, there are many ways to do so (many that are not apparent to the user at all).
Browsers DO change the websites look through the way CSS is handled (CSS for style, HTML for content). They would argue that the plugin is changing / added content to their site more so than style looking different ... And the content wouldn't be changing from browser to browser  Of course that is a moot point and there is still no basis for lawsuit. I have 200 plugins installed that can overlay different info about a site or I can use to add content to the site, the changes don't affect the site directly  If they were going to sue, they would have to sue Google also!!!!!! Google using the chrome browser has abuilt in console you can use to edit HTML / CSS for your viewing only to change anything you want about a site! So basically if they could sue you for what your plugin does....then every website on the internet could sue google if they wanted.... And they would... Because money....
We tried something like WebAssign for two years in my department. The idea was that to use it at the beginning of the semester for diagnostic tests and review questions. It worked, but there was really no benefit over paper assignments, except for automated grading. Plus, students had to overcome technical hurdles as well: access codes problems, entering math expressions in a web form, incompatible browsers, etc. We did not like it, the students did not like it, and we did not renew our subscription.  My opinion is that the whole thing is basically fast food. Lots of cookie-cutter questions that emphasize the wrong things -- applying formulas and calculating answers, rather than thinking creatively and communicating in a clear way. You can write your own questions (the quirky syntax reminded me of the PILOT language of the 1960s) but it's very hard to write good questions (you need to be always conscious of the limitations of the medium, which cramps your style) and especially good feedback for common errors. In the end you resort to lots of copying and pasting, students quickly get the hint and stop reading feedback.  The best I could say for them is this: they might help some bad instructors lose less, but will not help good instructors win more.  I want to make it clear that I'm not at all a technophobe. I was an early adopter of symbolic algebra software in my department, and today we emphasize it all over the curriculum. Last year, my final exam for multivariate calculus was done in the computer lab and students were encouraged to use Maxima for their calculations. They still had to write their answers in essay form (e.g. "We can compute the moment of inertia by evaluating &lt;some integral&gt; using Maxima, which gives &lt;some answer&gt;") and submit their Maxima file electronically.
If you actually knew something about law you would know that is not that different in different countries, the principles, sources and several other things are pretty much the same.
I'm personally more interested in warranties than returns - but the EU also legally requires a [minimum 14-day, no questions asked return period for all purchases.](http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/shopping/shopping-abroad/returning-unwanted-goods/index_en.htm) I'm not aware of any US law that sets a similar mandatory period, although I'm not an expert on international consumer rights by any stretch. According to [this site,](http://consumer.findlaw.com/consumer-transactions/return-policies-and-refunds.html) the USA doesn't have similar protections - although many retailers have their own policies. I'd argue that a 2 year free warranty is a pretty huge deal. If you're buying a $2000 laptop in the USA, for example, you're going to get a one year warranty unless you pay hundreds of dollars more. Of course, if you're buying it in the EU, you're paying VAT, so that sort of pays for the benefit - but I think in general it's incorrect to say that the USA has better consumer protection than other countries.

On the other hand, a court might see the existence of such a sign as an admission that the company knew that the rocks on the truck were not properly secured, thereby increasing liability of the company.

Slapping it as a requirement for a portion of your grade that only profits you and not the school sounds illegal. Not selling extra study material.
Just like robin hood :)
Wrong. Ignore their emails. They're just trying to intimidate with no legal basis. Ignore away. 
Sounds like what a professor for a notoriously easy sociology class at my school does. There's a $110 textbook for his class that's just a shitty compilation of other peoples' work that he put together, but there are perforated pages in the back that you need to fill out and tear out to receive attendance credit. So you essentially need the book for 20% of your grade, and the tearing out of pages destroys the resale value. Apparently, he even requires you to mail the pages to him when the class is being given online. That class was a scam if I've ever seen one, but it's just a more blatant version of what so many classes do (i.e. required online homework).
Thanks for your answer!, yeah that is what I thought. I will just keep on trying :).
I was in undergrad in Canada over 10 years ago and generally paid about $100 per textbook from my campus book store.  I imagine they're more expensive now.

The company that employs the driver is the one responsible for damages. I'd feel far more comfortable driving behind a truck where the person operating it will be personally responsible for damage.
Is that a valid reason in 2015?  If the college is unable to supply the information it's students need without exorbitant fees, then what is the justification for it's existence?  My own degree is now available for free on the internet, fully accredited at the University of the People, for example, whereas 10 years ago I paid around $80,000 and had to serve in the military, and fight in a war, to come up with the money.  I don't think colleges truly appreciate the sacrifices that people make for an education if they allow companies like Follett to push them around.

The argument from Follett seems to have no worthwhile merit, and I agree wholeheartedly with your cause.  However, have you found any population of people (other than the ones who stand to lose money, ex. Follett) that oppose your web extension and the goal it attempts to achieve?

lets not forget when your lab instructor writes the lab manual, then has a local copier place fulfill the orders and sell you their professionally photocopied plastic bound lab book for $150.    it is really nice when a professor says you can use old editions.  $20 torn cover, here i come.  my best purchase was my optics book.  nearly perfect, except it was bound so the cover was upside down.  you had to open the back cover, upside down, to get to page 1.  other than that, fine/flawless, but conceptually impossible to read for more than 15 minutes at a time.

I worked there 2005-2009 while attending school myself, and I know Follett had sort of a monopoly on the bookstores in terms of how they operated. Towards the end of the time I was there the new bookstore manager went out of their way to try to get books as cheap as possible for students, but the students who went there arent normal. This school cost $64,000 a year right now, and most kids gives 0 fucks about book price. Put it on daddys card.
I've had two experiences. The first was a complete waste of money and nowhere near worth the $120 I didn't pay due to abuse of the free trial period. It was 12 multiple choice quizzes. For one hundred and twenty fucking dollars.  The second was a pretty fair deal. I paid $25 and got a shitload of curated videos and texts ranging from lectures to studies to cutouts of shows and stuff and so on. The texts ranged from primary documents to excerpts from textbooks. Also included short quizzes over the content. 
As a college student, I have a comment that I'll phrase in the form of a question... Have you thought of changing the title of this AMA to "I'm a goddamn hero"?
This whole dialog is why reddit is an awesome community. 
This sounds like a great thing, and it reminds me of the libgen chrome extension which overlayed libgen downloads on Amazon books. Before it got removed.   I later found it in a .zip file on a forum. Would it be possible for you to create a zip file? Because things happen, and I don't want to see it go away forever if things escalate.
You mean a sterling offer to integrate this API into Honey? This is a business offer and should be treated as such. As a note, not all business offers are bad. This could help both businesses and the consumer by joining forces.
I don't get how it's made. "You don't use a paper filter" confuses me. 
Damn that sucks :(
Burst out laughing way too loudly.
I don't understand why more professors arent using open course books for things like intro biology, chem, physics, etc. Even for literature classes so many classics are out of copyright and available for free online.
Yeah, I loved paying tuition for an hour long lecture that scarely covered the content of the quizzes and tests, only to goto a computer lab and receive help from a pile of TA's/Math Students who had little interest in explaining the concepts. This was for Trig @ UCF.

What would happen if they just answered "lol" or"k."? Cause if would so do that.
I googled and found out more. You boil water in a pot. Meanwhile, you scramble the egg with the coffee grounds to turn it into an appetizing brown slurry with eggshell bits (it's important to keep the shell). Then you pour the slurrry into the boiling water. The grounds will ball up because of the egg. After about 3 minutes, you add some cold water which will make the ball of grounds sink. Then you filter through a sieve to serve.  After doing some more research, the purpose of the egg seems to be only to help the grounds stick together which makes the filtering easier (for cost savings, from what most websites say). The eggshell, on the other hand, counters the coffee's acidity due to its alkaline nature. So apparently, we can get smoother coffee just by using the eggshell-in-your-grounds part of all this, no need to mess with the actual egg and boiling water. Note, however, that any no-paper-filter method does make a smoother coffee because the coffee oils are not trapped by the paper. Unfortunately, those oils are also not very good for us if consumed too regularly.
What does the word "occupy" refer to? I get bad associations, which is too bad for this otherwise great idea.
Seems completely baseless. If they want to argue you are creating an unauthorized derivative work then they should sue the browser manufacturers for modifying HTML into a rendered website.  ToS are hard enough to enforce against users who accepted them, let alone against third parties interacting with those users.
&gt;* Students *need* the textbooks, so they're (generally) willing to overpay vs. not acquiring the book at all -- especially underclassmen   That's called "inelastic demand". I learned that from a $200 economics book. So worth it.

From the insurance company stand point. If it hits the road, it's road debris and in most states not covered. It's impossible to determine its origin. The sign is bs and means little in court. Side note: If an object comes off a truck and hits your window, never ever say "it bounced off the road". This assumes you've chased this guy down and at the very least gotten a tag/dot number. Say it grew wings and flew directly into the window.

That's pretty awesome of you. I know you guys have worked with lawyers in the past, but I would advise you to have someone look over what Follett sent before doing anything. Nonsense claims are not always legally baseless, especially in tech where law hasn't caught up.
Awesome! Thank you for taking the time to reply. The extension looks great, I'll be sure to let all my friends at school know about it!
Dude, Follett is full of dicks. I used to work at one of their bookstores in Georgia and the only reason I lasted long with them was because my manager treated me like his equal. In all honesty, they are horrible. They bought a large warehouse costing them upwards of a million dollars (I heard from my manager) and later on that year they let go of our supervisors except for one because they needed to save money.   Just assholes.

Planet Money did a followup episode last November about how textbooks are a timing-sensitive market, and how one can actually make money if they can cheaply store and ship textbooks, in [a form of arbitrage](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/11/10/363103753/textbook-arbitrage-making-money-off-used-books).  Textbooks are most expensive at the start of a semester/quarter, and the most worthless at the end of one, and of course college bookstores are accustomed to being the only seller in town.  They speak with a pair of men who store textbooks very cheaply after buying them greatly discounted at the end of the semesters/quarters, and selling them at the start to other students.  They can offer huge discounts over the new-book price while still making an assload of money over the price they paid.  (Of course, they risk ending up with a boatload of inventory of books that stop getting taught, etc.)    OP, this is a great service.  I wish it was around (along with, well, most of the internet as we now know it) when I was in school.

That's why this is something that needs to be addressed by higher-ups who actually have the wherewithal to set the school's mission.  A good example would be my school's library, one of the largest in the US with over 6 million books on hand.  And through various (pricey) arrangements they could give you access to millions more, on top of all the latest research publications, priceless artwork, and first-editions.  Yet for some reason that didn't include more than a handful of textbooks.    Just to put that into perspective, that library is now functionally obsolete.  To date Google has scanned over *20* million books into a searchable format and plans on scanning the other 110 books known to be in existence as well.  Students no longer need the school library, but they still need a solution to pricey textbooks.

Yea for sure.  We're not qualified to give out legal advice but what we can do is share our experiences.
Can you and your team possibly develop some sort of app that will be able to identify any person who earns more than 100k a year, and kill them when they open it on their phone?

Organize with your classmates, set up a distraction for your professor, while one of you uses any of the various tools to encrypt his hard drive or set up a password on his PC.  Do not give the code unless the professor realizes that this is exactly what he's doing.

Yes, truly a vichyssoise of wonderful questions, replies, and dialogue. Yay!
I'm in a class now where the prof wrote her own book. ~200 pages but only $15. It was looseleaf. I thought that was a great price so I didn't mind. However, I've also been in classes that had overpriced books you didn't need with tear out quizzes and spot checks to make sure you actually had the book. And this this semester I had a 60 page book with no used books available that was $70. Those people can go fuck themselves.

Have educators ever accepted "gifts" from publishers too force expensive texts onto their students? 
[deleted]
Ya, these guys are helping college kids save hundreds of bucks they don't even have for free by just taking a scrap out of the price of the textbook sales from their affiliates. Literally Hitler raping a kitten.
I had a professor last semester who told us that she was offered a paid trip to a resort by a textbook company trying to push a book.
Yeee! Pasadena! that's my hometown.   Why is Pasadena on reddit so much!? I see it EVERYWHERE lol. definitely not just confirmation bias.
&gt; Retailers need to learn that customers aren't stupid and will seek the best deal.   You've got that right! And they are only getting smarter. During the first day of class, I talk to my classmates about where they are buying their book, prices, etc. I also recommend a source if I know one. This last semester, I was about to pick up a $150+ textbook for around $15 on Amazon, and I told everyone in class that they could do they same.   The traditional textbook industry is an epic ripoff that often delivers far less value than the money a student pays. I refuse to play their idiotic game, and when I see the companies doing it, I just remember to avoid doing business with them in the future.
[deleted]
This really needs to be seen. 
Yep. This happened to me in undergrad. Was taking [science course], and there was a laboratory class associated with it, which had a lab manual. Now, of course, you HAVE to buy the manual, period, otherwise, there's no possible way to do any of the class work.  Anyways, so our professor was telling us how she rewrote the curriculum and made her own lab manual for the class. She'd print them out and sell them to the students for $15 to cover material cost. The next semester, the university's bookstore took her printed manual, got a publisher involved, and made it a fancy book with a cover all without informing her. Anyways, so our class shows up, and some people have this fancy book. The professor's mind just broke. The next class around, she brings the entire class to the bookstore and they all demand full refunds, which they ultimately get because this professor was essentially a Dean. The price of that book? $175, no refunds normally.  The university said she HAD to require a textbook and it HAD to be bought from the bookstore. So, she told everyone to buy a ream of paper from the bookstore, and give it to her to print out the book for free. I go out to lunch with her, and every semester, she changes the cirriculum so the bookstore always has outdated textbooks they are trying to use to steal from students. 
How many students actually purchase these things, I went to a pretty good school had alot of these online codes "mandatory" bought maybe one or two in four years and still did really well. How many professors actually use these codes?
I just love how George himself appeared and took a celebrity shot in the beer pong match against Follett. Truly wonderful stuff.

Example?
I have a great story. The school I went to for my bachelors required every class to have a textbook and that textbook be bought from the school book store.  So, being a dumb uninformed freshman, I bought a cell biology textbook for about $225. I never opened it. Never. One semester later, I came back with that book, still in the shrink-wrap. They only gave me $20. One winter later, the same book was for sale again, at $225. I never bought a book like that ever again.  Fast forward a couple years to graduate classes. I needed some biochemistry, anatomy, and organic chemistry books. All in all, the total cost for the semester was going to be about $1800 in books, which is modest for 3 courses worth of science books. Anyways, I bought them all online, from Amazon, one edition behind the current edition. My total bill was $40. The editions were identical, from cover image to end-book references.

If the extension becomes popular enough, Amazon may reduce affiliate payouts in order to make more money. Other booksellers would suffer because of it, albeit ever so gently.

I had a professor who wanted to switch from the textbook to his own curriculum hosted on the school's website. The textbook company paid to fly him out to a "sales seminar", which was a first class flight, five star hotel, fine dining, the works. They tried everything short of offering him $1000 and a hooker to keep using their textbooks.  He later went through and calculated based on the textbook he previously required and how many students he had (freshman level general fine arts elective) they were theoretically losing over $10,000/year in gross profit. And that was a cheap textbook.
It should be considered racketeering. "That's a nice GPA you have there, it'd be a shame if you couldn't turn in your homework."

"is" should be "can be"  Because the admins still allow /r/picsofdeadkids.
All my teachers would usually tell us to buy the old versions, and give us the pages for both versions, and if the new one included something new they would just scan it in and put it online.  My one professor who has written a textbook has never updated versions, and said she never will. She spent years making it perfect, and there is no reason to update it, if any theory changes in her lifetime I think her plan is to just add it on to a book website.

...and what would stop it from going to trial?  The court doesn't dismiss the lawsuit just because you don't contest it.

Ignoring it = losing the case.

This is the latter.  The bookstores are complicit in the fraud by willingly carrying the useless "products" of the booksters doing the fleecing.

Thank you
That's true, but if you sue a random celebrity, the court will find that you don't have cause, and will throw the case out.  When the book seller's lawyers show up, they'll easily be able to demonstrate cause.  They may lose the case after both sides present their arguments, but the court will see that there's something to litigate here, and a legal opinion is needed to settle the dispute.   If you're not there, guess who wins.  Hint: it ain't you.
Thanks for the kind words.  Stuff like this puts a smile on our face for a week.  :)

Again, IANAL, but if the book seller can show cause for the suit, and the court agrees that it's worth examining, you'd have to defend yourself.  You can't go around harassing people with frivolous law suits, or you can get sued yourself, as in your celebrity example.  In this case OP is having a direct impact on the book seller's business.  OP might be on the right side of the line, but he's close enough to it that he could very easily end up in court.

My professor writes his own books, distributes them for free online, and sells print copies for $10 (cost of printing). You may have seen some of his books around - Think Python, Think Baysian, Think Matlab, etc. 
Morally and ethically I'm generally pro-creator/pro-labor and find all the banter on Reddit about copyright generally frustrating in the lack of understanding in how investment and risk works in the arts world.  All that said, I see no ethical or moral issue with what you're doing in that realm, either. Admittedly, I do wish your brand wasn't so politicized: usually I find that unhelpful. Sometimes academic ebooks/books will be expensive because they are expensive to produce and the pool of buyers is limited to advanced students. Some of this research is subsidized, some of it isn't. Sometimes the pricing is subsidized in part (for now, Amazon), sometimes it isn't. It's a complex issue. But I see no problem with showing anyone the different pricing available and I hope you don't have to formally defend against that.
Hopefully the "best" doesn't include getting counter-sued for harassment, and possibly sent to jail for contempt of court.    Though there are plenty of litigation-happy people out there who look at every possible incident as a potential lottery ticket...and plenty of slime-ball attorneys who are happy to spin the wheel as well.  It's one of my biggest complaints about our system in the US.  The resulting excess litigation is a huge drag on our economy, especially when combined with the insurance companies and the medical industry.  It stifles innovation, rewards the most cynical among us and is basically a huge tax on every good and service that you buy or sell.    * accidentally a word

Although you're absolutely right that printing new editions is an important money-making technique, there is another important reason that most people aren't aware of.   The bottom line is, the professor is the customer publishers are selling to, not the students. And many professors like shiny new books. If they're going to compare books from one publisher with a 2010 edition of a book vs. another publisher with a book published in 2014, many will pick the newest one. As for price, they don't really care since they get the books for free.   [This blog post](https://burnadams.wordpress.com/2010/11/20/college-textbooks-and-health-insurance/) goes into it a little more. 
I get why you would feel that way. My comment was in response to someone else going off about how a for profit venture that used the word "occupy" was deceptive or misleading, or something like that. I can see how without that context my comment would seem odd. I can see how it seems odd even with the context.
Terrible idea.

"We need you to pay an extra $90 for the professor's convenience" is ridiculous.  "We need you to pay an extra $90 to prove you aren't cheating" is downright insulting.  Also, even with traditional textbooks from large publishers, the answers become "open-source". I had some financial difficulties at one point and couldn't afford the required text for my physics class, so I... acquired a copy online. Guess what? The online copy came with the instructor's solution guide.

Follett understood the importance of demonstrating the value that integrity, accountability, customers, each and every associate, innovation and teamwork plays in the success of a business.  Although many years have gone by, the values that helped us become the leading educational provider remain the same.  We constantly strive to be the provider of choice by putting customer satisfaction first, delivering exemplary service and the highest quality products. This philosophy is reflected in the commitment of Follett's associates, who work tirelessly to make Follett a true partner in the educational process by living our core values every day.  **Always do the right thing -- Integrity**  **Own the outcome -- Accountability**  **Put customers at the center of all that you do. -- Customers**  **Be open, honest, and transparent -- Each and Every Associate**  Challenge yourself to find a better way. -- Innovation  Go farther together. -- Teamwork"   Thought you'd need a good chuckle

Yes. The highest mark-ups seem to be on the books I actually need. 
Interestingly, it appears that price inflation isn't working too well for the publishers. I read a few weeks back on NPR that [students aren't actually spending more on textbooks](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/09/354647112/how-college-students-battled-textbook-publishers-to-a-draw-in-3-graphs) over the last ten years or so. There's either a maximum price that people tend to believe is reasonable, or students are wising up to their other options. Not to mention that those other options - like downloading e-textbooks, legally or illegally, renting instead of buying, and buying used books online - are becoming more feasible thanks to the internet and things like this Chrome plugin.
How do you plan to make every college student aware of the resources you have given them?
You do realize that if products didn't come with warranties, they would break far more often. A multiyear warrantee is a guarantee that the product is high quality.  In the USA, all products are mandated by law to offer a one year warrantee. I don't know what Europe's is. Go to China and you will see what happens when there is no legal minimum in product quality. Hell, when I was traveling in China, a local accused the USA of stealing all of China's quality products. I had to explain that the USA does not force China to sell their better wares to the US, but instead if they want to sell in the US market, the product must meet the minimum standards in quality, which is working for at least one year under normal conditions without failure.
Hence the comment about the free market. We don't have a law, we just have Costco, which has a return policy of "if you're not happy, return it" in addition to having a free 2 year warranty on all electronics.

Damn you are getting shit on, but for the most part you are right. There is a reason that most stores in the US have good return policies (some such as Nordstrom to the point of being ridiculous). It is because if they didn't people would just shop elsewhere
You can't make that analogy, retail stores versus websites have far different rules. That's just not how it works.

A few more points:  The books are selected by professors, who have almost no incentive to keep the price low. Worse, they can have a conflict of interest if they wrote the textbook. I had a professor who, while he only charged $25 or so for his textbook, he updated it every semester so you *had* to buy it.  Yes, students need them, but the other thing to consider is that students are already paying a significant amount of money to go to college. There are two ways to look at this: One way is, if you can barely afford to go to college, paying $100/book extra is onerous. But another way to look at it is, you're probably already paying almost $1k for the course anyway in raw tuition, not counting room/board/supplies/etc, so textbooks are comparatively cheap next to the rest of education. On top of that are all the endless scholarships.  Of course that goes double if loans are factored in, but that drives up education pretty evenly, I'd think. Universities are also charging more, because you can get an absolutely massive loan as a student, and not have to live with it until you already graduate and are already making more than you would without a degree, which means everything about a college education (at least in the US) can basically be priced as though it were an investment, towards [20% to pretty much double your salary](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/upshot/is-college-worth-it-clearly-new-data-say.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=1).  There's another factor at play here which makes this unlikely to change anytime soon: The fact that there's such a massive demand for a college education, and college-educated workers, means it's just good business for colleges to inflate their grades as much as they can get away with while still holding onto whatever accreditations they care about. But as SMBC says, ["The easier college gets, the dumber you look for not having a degree,"](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2729#comic) so for the moment, it doesn't matter how irrelevant and stupidly easy a degree gets, it's still going to be worth the price.
It only appears when shopping for something - and it's very good at it (I've even saved money from Steam with it). It also has adblock and tracking blocker built in.

You do know you can disable that extension just like any else, both during installation and after you've installed?

I wouldn't even go to small claims court without a lawyer.
Looks like I'm late to the party.   I am a college professor and I absolutely hate that my students have to buy such outrageously expensive textbooks. In my department,  we are required to use the same books for certain courses,  so,  sadly, I don't have much of a choice in the matter. I do,  however, always encourage my students to find their books online through websites like Amazon and Chegg. I will most definitely be adding your site and add-on to my list of recommendations for my students. Spring semester begins in two weeks, are you guys ready?
We are always in the spotlight for wrong things.   Which class was this for ??   I am so glad I didn't have to take a class like that. 
Such a reddit boner rn
Will it overlay the free torrent links?
That is absolutely disgusting, that professor is an horrible human being. 
A lot of that is framing. For example:  &gt; For example, many people will spend an extra five minutes to save $5 on a gallon of milk...  I won't. I'll spend more than an extra $5 to [get that gallon of milk delivered](https://fresh.amazon.com/), because I've framed that as a price I'm willing to pay to not have to go shopping, rather than a savings I could get by shopping smarter.  Clearly many students *do* use services like Amazon and Chegg -- I was probably the only person I know who didn't bother going too far out of my way to save money on books. I think there's a framing effect you're not considering here for the books -- at least for some students, tuition is sort of abstract and not psychologically felt. It's paid for by some combination of parents, scholarships, and student loans. Textbooks aren't always grouped with that, and if textbooks come out of your actual spending money, it suddenly matters a lot -- $50 less student loans makes no difference, but $50 more to spend *right now* on pizza and beer makes a huge difference.  (None of this applied to me -- my university let me charge textbooks to the university bill alongside my tuition, and I just did that and spent the $50 on pizza and beer anyway.)  I think the big-ticket item thinking is probably not done for rational reasons, but I think along pretty similar lines, and I think it's rational:  &gt; Same sort of thinking with extended warranties or pointless accessories: I'm spending $1,000 on a TV, what's an extra $50?  Well, extended warranties and pointless accessories are pretty much always pointless. But let's frame it another way: A TV can be had for either $1,050 in the store I'm in, or $1,000 in another store. But to even find that out costs time, and time is money. I'm then going to have to drive across town, which costs more time and probably more money (gas money, public transit, cab/lyft fare, etc). Then I'm going to have to talk to a *second* salesman, and research the second TV, and so on.  That might not add up to $50, but it's also not certain that I'll choose the cheaper TV until I actually get there to compare it. And even if it does end up saving me money, it's saving me less than $50, and on an *extremely infrequent* purchase.  On the other hand, I know a bagel shouldn't cost $50, and I know where I can find a dozen bagels for less, and I eat bagels much more often than I buy TVs. And I know extended warranties are bullshit without even looking at the price.
Has there been an federal investigation as to how follette can charge hundreds of dollars more than what the book cost? that professors/instructors are most likely getting kickbacks from follette.
&gt; The book was printed by the campus copy machine (...) The price for this "book"? $170 +tax.  We had exactly the same problem in our college. We bought one copy, scanned it to pdf and printed it on an ordinary laser printer, $3 per copy. Illegal? Maybe. But forcing students to buy insanely overpriced books no one else in the world reads should also be illegal.
Because all anti virus apps fall to disgusting bloat.
My method was to do the practice problems, and just program excel u til it would give me a perfect answer.
Honestly, for my physics classes yahoo answers and excel taught me more than the textbook and my professor for the second semester.

This is an attitude I dont understand. Taking money from them? Thats not how it works, what you are doing is spending your hard earned money in a different place. You're not "taking" jack shit from them.

Imagine that you're in a book shop, and you've hired someone to follow you around and inform you about better deals on everything that you look at in the store. It's not illegal. That's basically what this extension does.
Can you explain this. Cause the way it is now seems like you are taking courses twice to save a few hundred bucks.
Maybe they don't.
The copyright one I can *absolutely guarantee*, beyond a shadow of a doubt, is complete BS. From a technical standpoint, virtually every single part of the internet would be illegal if that was how copyright worked. I've seen the plugin, you aren't creating and distributing their pages separately from them, you're injecting HTML *into* the pages, *after* they've been loaded. Not even interfering with communication between the client and server. That violates exactly *no part* of copyright law.   Any more than if I sold you a print of a painting, and you paid someone else to paint Chewbacca into it. No one's violating copyright law, a third party is being retained at specific request of the licensed user to make a modification that is not replicating the original in any part.  Also, the browser itself equips users to breach their TOS significantly more than your tool does. And I'm fairly certain simply 'equipping' users to breach TOS isn't even against any laws in the first place, otherwise all the penetration testing tools I use for work would *most certainly* be illegal, because they 'equip' me to do a lot more than that.
+1 for noticing and pointing out is attention to detail (or trivia knowlage) that no one else noticed.
In case you want a real answer: It's part of how they're making money on their free antivirus.
Just out of curiosity, I am really not that familiar with the legal system. But if their legal threats are bullshit anyways and have no merit, what do you still need a lawyer for? Why not just defend yourself, say that its bullshit and that's that?
&gt;with a discreet local bar association logo  That's beautiful. You're going to go far.
This made me want to tape a whisk to my Kuerig and take a picture. I'm too lazy to actually do this. But I wanted to. 
Jesus, it's like they're writing a heartfelt, personal letter asking people to pirate the books. 
This is a fantastic idea! What bookstore alternatives are covered? e.g. where I live, I always know book depository will end up cheaper (and faster/ more likely to deliver than amazon) and textbooks are far too expensive here (New Zealand) so it's always necessary to check.

U only have to re-do the exam.  So U are actually just postponing your examination.  
I agree. Textbook vendors dont only need to suffer the future of lost sales but they should suffer vengeance for years of preying on students. They should crash and burn, fucking parasites.
I feel for American students - you guys get absolutely shafted with textbook prices.  I think over three years I spent less than 100 on second hand textbooks, and then recouped some by reselling.  I hear nightmare stories of lecturers demanding receipts and brand new editions to even pass a module? Is that even true/legal?
Has anyone actually gotten the extension to work on their google chrome browser? I have it added but when i search for a textbook, nothing comes up? does any one know why that's?

I don't get if they are still being sued and why the rebuilding &amp; re-branding took place?

Many (most?) states do
This is what is really sad.  Lawsuits can be baseless but still ruin people and companies, and by doing so they help keep us in the dark ages, business-wise if not technology-wise.  Until something is done about the systemic problem that more money makes you right in a practical sense, injustice is free to run amok.  Stay strong guys....
how?
It's not even that odd. I just found it slightly humorous on a semantic level and everyone is going apeshit about nothing.
Still seems too good to be true. But thanks for responding
One of my literature classes tried to do this with a pack of brand new American Lit readers in shrink wrap. I asked if I could buy one of them separately and when they said no, I said (ok mumbled) "That's Un-American!" and left. The public library had the book I needed for free.  I love libraries. But I feel bad that its not usually an option for actual textbooks or online codes. 
This is outside of the U.S. So yeah.

except for the kill cops circle jerk.
&gt; It just doesn't make sense where you could just bill the school based on their usage instead.  But that would give the folks actually paying the cost negotiation power over compensation. Keeping that cost in the hands of the individual end-user provides no such power.
Well, for starters, Razor1911 doesn't do shit anymore.  RELOADED and SKIDROW are the ones that do the popular stuff nowadays.  Also, most keys for games have some database in the background that knows which keys are actually in circulation. Those keygens (which are *very* rarely used nowadays) only work if the game/software doesn't have that, or if you just need it to install the game and can only play offline.
He doesn't know, he just believes in his heart of hearts that he's superior to these ingenious developers. You know, like most oblivious assholes tend to feel this way. Pro tip: when someone begins with "that's cute," you are most likely dealing with an oblivious asshole. You can just tell he's a conservative moron.
Alright man, chill, jeez. Sorry for being less than completely right on the internet.
I didn't mean this aggressively at all, just wanted to put out there why keygens don't always work.
Walter O'Brien already got himself a TV show.
Sorry, I meant as you said. Still, they might see it exactly that way.
Does that mean if you *are* a lawyer you say IAmAnal? Seems rather apposite.
I teach biostatistics and do the same as you..no textbook.  I do have to put together a lot of readings from here and there..online chapters, blogs,  journal articles.  A lot of statistics textbooks are written after someone starts teaching it, only to realize nobody has a text that fits their way of teaching. Ha!

Thank you for that last line, basically confirming you were part of the problem.
Will this work with sites that use Nebraska as their system? I used to work on campus at the bookstore so I know we're not part of fillet but we use Nebraska's online system with WinPrism

Thank you. Will be doing that from now on. 
It's a matter of both law and tradition. Ultimately, it's **people** who decide how good of a product they should offer on the market. It those people universally have no scruples, you get what you have in China. This mindset is pervasive through the culture, I see it daily in engineering as well. It's typical Chinese engineering to take the shortest route from point A to point B, everything else be damned. You can get "wonderful" products that way, designed with not an ounce of understanding. You get mimicry and cargo cult engineering.  I strive to have designs that minimize the likelihood of failure, and I do that not because the market or the employer forces me to, but because that's ultimately what makes me be the person that I am. In fact, I sometimes make improvement on my own time, to keep the costs to my employer minimal - I simply enjoy squeezing out the most performance given a limited cost of the bill of materials.  So yes, I do "realize" that when there is no legal requirement, the tradition takes over, and if said tradition is rotten to the core, you get crap on shelves.
Not really. The people who "sold" those books back could have taken the books themselves and sold them on Amazon. 
I wish there was some discussion here of the fact that the largest problem in cost is a used textbook distribution problem. Follett, Nebraska, and Barnes and noble run thousands of college stores, but they also own used textbook distribution (replace Barnes and Noble with MBS, which is owned by the largest shareholder of Barnes and Noble).  If a college bookstore is independently run by the institution you have a much better chance of that store wanting to actually lower prices. But they rarely can, because the cost of used books (from MBS, Follett, and Nebraska) is TIED to the cost of new books and thus rises at exactly the same astronomical rate.   Here's a solution: independent stores, after individually Collecting thousands of adoptions from unruly faculty, need better software to help them source hard to find bulk quantities of used books. Guess who created the software nearly all of these independent stores currently rely on? MBS, Follett, and Nebraska. So the existing software doesn't do much to help stores source low-cost books.  The solution to the problem for an individual may be Amazon. The solution to the problem at larger scale is, ironically, supporting the bookstore, turning the store independent, and helping faculty understand that the store is aligned with academic values (academic freedom) while the publishers move toward assessment and standardization (access codes and digital tools that dictate curriculum). Then the stores need better software that isn't run by the enemy.  It's a viscous cycle, and one where what's good for individuals (buying cheap from Amazon, selling high to chegg) accelerates the problem for the bookstore, who gets less and less books in buyback from students and is more and more reliant on MBS, Follett, and Nebraska for used book distribution. 
To play the devil's advocate again, that is another reason for a new edition every couple years. New questions, new solutions . . . until the answers are published online again, bringing a need for a newer edition. 
Better late than never, thanks for checking in!  If you're comfortable, can you tell us more about the process for deciding which books will be required?    I've read about textbook reps wining/dining professors and academic directors, and am curious if you've ever seen anything like that.
You are a very, very, very good professor. As a student, I feel like the texbook industry is poisoning education as we know it. I feel like higher education is more or less turning into a segway in which the textbook companies make money, with us learning stuff being shoved to the side somewhere in wake of that goal. It's an awful feeling.  Plus, I've found textbooks to be less than useful most of the time. 95% of what I learn outside of lecture is from my own research, usually on the internet. At least to me, Khan Academy alone has been far more useful than any math book ever has been, and that's free.
What does the word "occupy" refer to? I get bad associations, which's too bad for this otherwise great idea.
Are you planning on branching out to other browsers in the future?
How do you plan to make every college student aware of the resources you have given them?
Well, it seems to me their business strategy is actually about treating the sore buttholes that nearly every student suffers.
Current employee at Follett, I can tell you what we think of the "values". Complete. Joke.
If this case had any merit, Microsoft would be sued to oblivion thanks to what IE does to people's pages ;)

omg not a reddiquette violation! Someone call the internet police!
I love the idea, but I live in the netherlands - what are your plans on expanding your business in the netherlands?
Because any press is good press. You're making the point that it's bad, they're thinking 'thanks for the link, buddy!'
C'mon dude, his point is that if our community doesn't regularly follow the very rules it has made for itself, it's not much of a community.  I disagree, but it's still a comment that "contributes to [the] conversation" - unlike yours.
Why does it seem like more and more often instead of competing companies will just threaten to sue?
Well... At least you follow the "open, honest, and transparent" value 
School's finally paying off!
One of the first places funding is cut is for teaching assistants.  A lot of schools just don't have them and the access codes essentially take their place. 
the community didn't make the rules of reddiquette. they're rules set for us, not by us.

The majority of textbooks are chosen by teachers, and the majority of teachers are employed by state governments. So the price mechanisms are pretty messed up and not characteristic of free markets. 
Unless they uselessly shuffle around the sections :/ god that was stupid.
God, why don't they just sell the codes and homework as a service then instead of wasting all of that dead tree.  Capitalism is efficient my ass.
There are other options your pea brain hasn't considered, like maybe I emailed the professor and he said it would be fine despite the new version being "required".
When I use the plug-in I'm not receiving prices from any other site. Are you still adding to this or will Columbia College never show?
Are you searching books at http://columbia.bncollege.com/ ?  Can you go through the "course selection" process and see if it activates?  It's possible that we haven't yet added the new views for some pages, but we're actively working on them!
The issue maybe from the site to the bookstore, the link to the store is http://bookstore.mbsdirect.net/columbia.htm. I'm guessing it will not work as it is not apart of the three listed below.
This is good to know; let me look into this and get back to you.
Awesome, thank you.
The process varies from department to department,  but I have definitely seen textbook reps wining and dining professors.    In my department, we've been with the same publisher for a number of years and our rep is still sure to extend dinner invitations to "get to know her better"  or to "find out what's new and different in the latest edition." 
All malware is malicious, all adware is ad supported, some adware is malware....   Adware is just ad supported software... There is a continuum of maliciousness.
Sorry, forgot the suit was with the holding company "Sambreel"  Interesting stuff.
On the flip side, I had an electrical engineering professor who got so fed up with text book prices that he wrote his own text book and sold it for the price of getting it printed off at kinkos.
Jesus Christ. You need a new school. My school's bookstore has the features this browser extension has right in the site. They almost encourage us to buy used and not from them.
To be fair, most professors encourage us to buy used or rent. Right after the Pearson rep talked to my physics class, my professor told us not to listen to her.   Sadly that still doesn't change the online access code trend. 
Somehow, I had never heard of honey, thanks for providing that link. I can't wait to start using it.
 that's a whole lot of connecting
Let the f****** look at that kids maybe it will stop them from making their own dead children pictures
How does a plugin like honey make any money? It is free there is an ADS don't understand
I noticed that when re-reading this, and it's slightly cringe-y haha.  Could have thrown in a few more buzzwords.  Just always awkward to say "looking forward to meeting you" when it's obvious you're "only" going to jump on a phone call / Skype.
Got this from Product Hunt recently -Would your ext fit in with these featured " Cool Chrome extentions"?   http://www.producthunt.com/e/chrome-extensions?utm_source=Product+Hunt&amp;utm_campaign=d46834d3bb-Cool_Chrome_Extensions_Top_Hunts_Last_Week1_4_2015&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_2cd7d34185-d46834d3bb-121386893

I did not. Now I do. Thanks! :)
I meant the practice was stupid, not you, but thanks for the burn.
My apologies in that case, it sounded like you were calling my actions stupid.
Hi Ben, please feel free to reach out whenever you are available to discuss the tool I want to write. I think it would make a great addition to your site, and I would love to work with you on it. Take care.
Welcome to business school. Your first lesson is apparently to get fucked by a business. 
[deleted]
The extension doesn't activate when I'm on my school's bookstore. Is there something I need to do to activate it?
agreed. its also nice, that since he doesn't require his students to have a book, when he gets stuck on a topic, he cant just say, "EH oh well, i dont know, just look it up in the book".  Props to you sir.
unrelated, what's up with those people eating cacti on YouTube? what the fuck?
How is what you are doing any different than Verba?
Verba (as you know) sells / licenses software to bookstores to run price-comparison on their site.  We provide students (for free) a plugin to accomplish the same price-comparison on an unaffiliated bookstore site.  It also includes on-campus student listings.  In time, we'll also integrate open-source / royalty-free options (something I doubt bookstores / Verba will be open to).  If you're willing to share, I'd love to learn more about Verba's arrangement with their bookstore partners.  Is it a rev-share or does the bookstore keep 100% of the affiliate proceeds once integrated?
Is there an update on this?
Still nothing new from Follett.  At this point, our best guess (and hope) is that they realize that 1) their claims are baseless, and 2) they'll continue to do poorly in the PR arena.
