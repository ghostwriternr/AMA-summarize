My grandfather started a plastics manufacturing factory which grew to be a series of plastics, raw materials, and granite plants. My father was the only child, so he took over.
&gt;I'm so jealous. My parents bankrupted right as I got into high school and I had to pay my own way for my car and through college.I'm really sorry to hear that. To be honest I hate the kind of people I grew up with in my neighborhood who seem to have this absolute sense of entitlement.&gt;Anyways, do you feel like you value money as much as poorer people? Like, I make about $2500 a month and I had to work my ass off to get it. Do you look down on me because you're currently wiping your ass with that same amount? :) Do you view yourself as deserving this wealth and do you feel like poorer people don't work hard enough?Absolutely not-- I've never felt like I "deserved" the money, it's just what I was given. I will never look down on you based on how much money you have. I was taught to appreciate the value of money, and I took jobs when I was in highschool so I could learn, but it's never been a need for me so I can't say I see money the way most of the world does.&gt;You said your family is unhappy, do you think the money specifically correlates to this? I think all families have their own stories regardless of wealth, although I do get the sense that money has a role to play. I find that the roles me and my brother are taught to play since childhood are, however, somewhat causes for our personal unhappiness. I'll never admit to the "oh pity the poor little rich girl" route though.
I started a Disaster fund when I was in high school, worked for Oxfam for a year after high school, and our grandfather (who was the one who created the foundation to the wealth) requires a 10% "tithing" of all earnings to charity each year, which we all follow. 
Yes, I'd prefer to get to know you a bit more, but I don't have a problem with it. 
haha, apparently so
I have no idea. I'm not really interested in the family business (which will probably be given to my brother anyway because I'm a girl). I have a feeling I'll eventually go into nonprofit. 
&gt;Do you think you family is pretty stereotypical for a wealthy family (the unhappiness, infidelity, addictions, etc)?It is kind of cliche, isn't it? I definitely see similar trends amongst other families around me. Most of my friends have some kind of addiction.&gt;What was being raised like? Did you go to a private school with other wealthy children? Were their families similar to yours? What was that like?Private schools, private tutors, etc. Most of my classmates were in similar situations, especially the "oil kids" (sons and daughters of mid-eastern princes). It's the same as most highschool kids I'd imagine, we go to malls and gossip. &gt;You said your 'child, grandchild', does that mean you do have both?Neither, it was just a point of reference. I think if I had kids I would teach them humility first, and I will **NEVER** let them grow up around the people I grew up. &gt;How do you feel about capitalism, socialism, taxes being higher for your family than those that don't make as much, politics in general regarding making money?I think capitalism is a great idea, but I believe in universal healthcare simply from seeing its success in certain West European countries. I think rich people *should* pay more taxes. My father is conservative, and we don't see eye to eye on things like this. &gt;Do you think anyone can make the kind of money your family does, or is it really a matter of luck and circumstance?Luck counts for a lot, I think. But I'll never look at my grandpa and call him lazy, he was working up until his deathbed. 
I've tried weed, E, coke, shrooms, etc. I like weed, but it makes me tired too quickly.
He went overseas for work, met a woman, and had a child. He sends them money monthly, and they're aware of our existence. I don't think they have an "official" father, but I really don't know much about them.
I don't know-- there's only so much lying around I can do. I have certain obligations to the family in terms of representing them, but in terms of work I'll probably go into nonprofits.
&gt;What do you mean your father spends more time with his illegitimate family, as in, your father has two families?Yes, he found another woman and started a new family, then sends them money monthly. &gt;What does a typical day consist for you? The usual college life-- I don't party much anymore. God that sounded ridiculously ditzy. &gt;Are you happy?Moreso now than before. It took me a couple of years to get out of a suicidal depression (sad lil rich girl). I'm a bit more settled now.&gt;Do you belong to a country club?I used to, played golf for awhile, but I can't really stand being around those people for an extended period of time.&gt;Ever thought about doing the whole Angelina Jolie thing, trying to save the world?As cliched as it sounds, yes. There's a good chance it's what I'll end up doing with my life.&gt;You wrote that you were told you can have pretty much what you want.... what do you want?That is an incredibly good question.... I'll have to get back to you on that.
No, but this is very interesting.
&gt;How much control do you have over your money? Is there a filled-up bank account that's fully yours, or does everything flow through your parents, or just your father?I don't have a dollar to my name, per se-- all the money is under my parents'. &gt;How do you see your wealth affecting your path through life? Will you work? Will you work at a job that's fun? Will you work at a job that makes you even richer? Will you work at a job that doesn't pay well, but does something good in the world?I've answered similar here, but the gist of it is I'm looking to go into nonprofits.&gt;Do you mostly have rich friends? Have you tried to make friends with people who don't know about your wealth? Do you often worry that people like you for your money, and not for yourself?My general mentality when it comes to money and friends is "choose one". I've had too many 'friends' who stop calling after a loan or "business venture". I have a group of friends from my childhood who tend to be rich but share the same philosphy toward money, and I have a larger group of friends who are from various backgrounds.&gt;Do you feel like your wealth translates to power? Can you get away with things that most people can't because of it? Can you user your wealth to influence politics or business?In certain areas of the world, yes. I'm not going to pretend money doesn't make things easier or that people won't treat you better. I find a VERY large discrepensy between how people treat me with and without knowing about my background.&gt;When you daydream about your future, do your dreams involve being rich, or being normal/anonymous?I prefer anonymity, by far. I don't tell most people about my family. People act very differently towards me when they find out, they tend to either become guarded or demanding.&gt;What's are some of the biggest misconception out there about very rich people?We're normal people. We're not smarter or better in any way. I don't like the idolization of the rich, it influences the world negatively.
Wow, I thought you were joking-- here's an idea, if you can incorporate yourself, send me a PM. This is a pretty simple process, but relives both you and I from legal problems. I can look into it as an investment so it's not a personal loan. The money I have isn't under my name, but investments I can pass it through my parents. 
&gt;It feels awkward going out to dinner, because she pays for everything. I think it would be equally weird if I always paid for everything. It's just so weird for me.My boyfriend is a poor student, it took a LONG time for us to get over the money issue. He insists on taking care of me, but I find it's ridiculous when we go to a restaurant and he's obviously concerned about the bill. It took a while for me to convince him that he takes care of me in other ways than finances. He makes me happy, and if he's not happy, I'm not happy. In a way, I'm investing in my own happiness. Our agreement is that if one of us want something more (i.e. if we're travelling and I want to stay at a better hotel for comfort and safety while he's comfortable with the $20 hostel), we'll cover the difference. So in the hotel example, He'll pay the $20 that he would have at the hostel, and I cover the hotel fees because it's something *I want*.My parents don't seem to care who I date very much.
&gt;Would you consider using your resources to start a huge non-profit centered at a solving a specific problem? If so which one?Oxfam. I've worked there for a year and they really do care about the causes, most of the money goes to those who need it rather than the administrative. &gt;You already know that money doesn't buy happiness, so how do you find it?If only I knew the answer to that question...&gt;Do you hide it from potential boyfriends? Yes. I don't like flaunting wealth, many of my friends don't even know about my background.&gt;What do you think of living in minimalism, being frugal, and using less to help the environment?I believe in living simply, and I see the responsibility in helping the environment. I try to use what I need most of the time and I don't make ridiculous purchases. 
&gt;What kind of social obligations did you have growing up?Tons. I was taught to look and behave like the perfect child, and I've pretty much mastered that role. Every weekend was a different function, and I got good at charming people pretty quickly. I also got really good at sneaking out during the middle of the party.
&gt;What motivates you to get up each day when there is no real need for you to even get out of bed?Because the world's amazing. There's so much to live for and there's so much beauty in the world.&gt;Would you please sponsor me for the St. Baldrick's foundation event in March 2010? I shave my head every year to raise money for childhood cancer research. With the bad economy this year I was personally only able to raise $215. In 2008 my team raised over $7000This is amazing-- I'll do you one better, aside from my personal donations, I'll send it to my friends as well. Just to clarify, you're Steve C. right?
&gt;Why are you on Reddit and not traveling the world?Reddit is a way of travelling the world for me as well. I've learned so much from this site, this is just my way of giving back a little.That said, I've been to every continent out there. It gets tiring after awhile.
I like Oxfam, but there's a ton of other organizations out there that do this every day. An hour or two of volunteer work can do amazing things for them, even if it's just on the phone talking to people. 
&gt;Are you worried that someone will only be after your money?Sometimes, but I don't really believe in marriage anyhow. My parents' weren't exactly the best example of how marriages should be.
Ninjas, of course. 
&gt;1) When/If you have children, would it not be a good idea to put a good amount of money into their savings account and only let them access it when they are 21+ and have truly learnt to value money?I don't think I'd even tell them about their finances. I want them to lead a normal life. &gt;2) Do you waste your money or despite being rich do you still choose the best value for money items?I believe in value for money, but I do still look at the better options. At the end of the day, I'm looking to fulfill needs that I had BEFORE I start shopping.&gt;3) Do you ever find that when people know how rich you are they treat you differently and suddenly you have more friends?Immensely. I try to hide my background when I meet people. Money changes people in ways most people don't see, I've lost friends who I would've trusted my life to over squabbles on money.
I'm not winning any awards, but I think I get by.
&gt;Don't any people your status in real life unless you have to, as you can tell many people here on reddit are straight up begging you for money; everyone wants a free lunch.Money changes people. I've lost some good friends due to squabbles over what's right and wrong, and I've been taken to court by people I've loaned money to. I've learned to be careful with it though.
Don't laugh, but I studied English lit and Marketing. 
&gt;Are you actually unhappy yourself, or is it just the family in general? Do you have any close friends? Do you do any work? Do you have a partner?I am pretty happy right now, I just think I grew up in a bit more conflict-driven environment. I have 4 close friends-- my boyfriend, my brother, and two friends that I see once or twice a year. &gt;I find rewarding work, friends, and if I'm lucky a nice girlfriend are the things that can make me happy. (And enough money for booze drugs and audio gear helps)I completely agree with you. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile but I have a pair of shures that I never keep far away from me.
&gt;Did you go to college? And what did you study?English lit and Marketing, don't laugh.&gt;Also, in all seriousness, would you like to fund a feature length documentary for a relatively small amount of money? It depends, I get requests like this alot, and most of the time my answer is to give me something in writing, like a business plan or something, and I'll send it to my parents (who legally own the money).
How well can you cook? Because my boyfriend makes a mean steak sandwich.
&gt;How much does this strain your relationship with them? Do they ever explicitly threaten to cut you or your brother off? Do they use money as a carrot / stick? When we were young my mom would always threaten to sell us, but aside from that not really. They're pretty reasonable people.&gt;Do the decisions you make in your life always involve thinking "how will my parents react?" In other words, would you avoid getting a tattoo/piercing because of your parents' reaction, would you get a tattoo/piercing to provoke a reaction?To an extent, my parents never really denied us anything, so I don't really see it as a threat much. My rebellious phase was as far as appearing in the Vagina monologues (local, not the original). My dad threatened to shut it down until my mom convinced him to see it. He couldn't stop laughing.&gt;Do you think you could ever get some of the money as your own money to gain a bit of independence from them? Have you ever considered trying to live your life as a non-wealthy person, making your own money and not taking anything from them?Of course, but to be honest with you I don't have the courage to.&gt;How successful have you been in being anonymous? Do people eventually find out? Do they pry? Do you have any friends who didn't know about your wealth before they met you, but who later found out and didn't change at all?I've been pretty good at keeping it quiet, it helps that I moved to a different city after turning 18. Most people don't ask or care to ask, so I've only had a handful of people find out. If I've known them for some time before they find out, they usually don't change. If they discover it within a short time after we've met, they either stop calling or suddenly need help. &gt;He tries really hard to be just one of the guys, but the fact that he misses out on a lot of the stress of life (like the stress of negotiating a mortgage) means he doesn't have the chance to learn from things like that, and has a poorer life as a result.I see what you mean, and I certainly can see how there's a sacrificed made when one is automatically given a lot of things, but I'm terrified of being the "poor little rich girl" cliche, so I just accept that I'm who I am and that I'm fortunate in ways some aren't. &gt;You don't see the demonization?Sometimes I do, but being behind the scenes at a lot of my parents' events growing up I see and hear a lot of chatter behind their backs (people don't realize how observant kids are). It changes how I see people, I guess. You see someone who walks up and is your father's best friend since college, and then you hear them telling their friends how you're a drug-addicted whore the next. &gt;People really seem to think that old money controls everything.No, that's just republicans.
Haha you got me there. I've been to the North Pole through Alaska once, it's really not that interesting.
&gt;What industry is your family business?Plastics, granite, and raw materials manufacturing. A bit of import/export. That's about the extent that I know about it. &gt;Would you consider your dad to be either ruthless, underhanded or very aggressive in business? I'm convinced it is incredibly difficult (but not impossible) to become very wealthy without being most of the above.I've seen certain behaviors in business amongst him and his collegues, and it does kind of turn me off. Backstabbing is an understatement in that world, and I've been at the butt end of that stick too many times.
Oh I feel tons of guilt when telling people about my "problems", mostly because I know that there are those who have it *so much worse*. Until I don't have running water and my family is dying of malaria, I feel like my unhappiness is mostly insignificant.
;) Thank you!
lol, thanks for pointing that out.
Don't thank me yet, I still have to run it through the bosses. It's always a good idea to incorporate yourself though, I was taught that by some very smart lawyers the kind of things you can protect yourself from by doing so.For one, list all of your major assets under different corporations, this way when you get sued for ANYTHING, they can only take what is under your name directly, and not under the corporations. 
I don't own one, sorry!
You're doing her a tremendous service that you're not aware of, get over the money issue already and let her be happy with you!
&gt;or spraypaint her name on an overpassThat sounds amazingly romantic, so long as he doesn't get arrested. I would melt if my s.o did that for me.
&gt;I'm really sorry to hear that people treat you differently, at least this way you get to know who your real friends are! :) It took awhile, but I've learned to see people when they want something more from you. Money can change people in ugly ways.&gt;How old are you? Also what are your ambitions when you're not restricted by money limitations? Must be a nice feeling!I'm 22, this might sound silly but I really wanted to get into woodworking when I was younger. There's something so pleasurable in working with your hands (get your mind out of the gutter).
Hahaha I think I'm ok looking, my s.o. seems to like the way I look so I'm happy about that. But sorry, you're going to need to beat up my boyfriend first in a cooking contest, and my money's on him right now.
&gt;What are you majoring in in college?Like I said elsewhere, don't laugh, but English lit and Marketing. The Marketing is really for my parents (they don't consider English to be a "real" major).&gt;It's good that it seems you've not let the money go to your head.It's easier that I grew up in it, rather than encountering it later on I suppose. I find that people are just people at the end of the day, no amount of LV tags will change that.
:( Sorry, I'll start correcting my ways.
I'm going to look to Kiva, it sounds like an amazing idea. I've developed a fear of personal loans because of a prior experience-- a friend of mine borrowed some money from my parents through me, and ended up suing us and spreading rumors that I was a drug addicted whore (seriously). It was a painful experience because we grew up together, and I would've gladly trusted my life with this person until this happened.
&gt;Who do you look up to and why?Anthony Robbins-- he's an amazing personality and has probably cracked the code to being a good person.&gt;Do you hang out with people who aren't as rich as you, people who are less fortunate? Do the financial differences make it harder?A good portion of my friends are oblivious to my background and are, I guess, "normal". There's no difficulty as far as I can tell, we're just good friends and money really doesn't play much into it.
I've stayed at hostels, both good and bad ones. Some have been amazing and the other ones are a little bit scary. At the end of the day, I am spoiled in that I like the little comforts. The Japanese hostel sounds like a blast, where in Japan was this?
I guess only the kitchen Colosseum will tell! 
I think it's mostly due to my grandfather, he made it a rule that 10% of all earnings in our family must go toward helping others-- he called it "tithing". He grew up in a truly poor background (his father sold his brother to another family to survive), and has always taught us to not take things for granted.
Hmm... I'm not sure how you mean, but I don't know if I have the courage to risk something like that.
That's a great quote, you should make sure it's copyrighted. I try to read as much as I can, but reddit sometimes keep me from doing so.
No way! Ninjas kill before you even see them, and Pirates don't even have depth perception. 
The shrooms scared the heck out of me, I was in Amsterdam, I didn't know where I was and I was terrified I was going to fall into one of the canals. I swore to never try it again.
:) I don't really comment much on this, I'm going to ask people to go check out Kiva now though, it's a really cool concept.
I agree, he taught me a lot, I wish he was still alive.
I do have a few bags that I like, including a Marc by Marc Jacobs bucket bag. I'm strangely not so much into shoes though, to the utter disgust of my friends. 
It's very satisfying, isn't it? To create something from something else and then take it apart.
Right now I live in Canada, my family lives in L.A., and my dad lives in Shanghai. 
No seriously, "wealth doesn't buy you happiness, but time"-- great quote.I speak 3 languages and play piano. Both effects from my childhood.
Yeah, I agree-- there's really not a lot of options for most people coming out of college with English lit. It's a great field of study and, imo, necessary in human development, but less so in terms of usefulness. 
I've met a lot of politicians, including Clinton once at a dinner function, and Al Gore after he did a talk. (Al Gore is um... plumper in person it seems). Not a lot of celebrities unfortunately, although Mel Gibson did buy one of my mom's paintings (that she bought, not made). 
Make friends with a lawyer, and do everything through them. I grew up with all sorts of horror stories of people trying to scam money from those around me--some ingenius, some not so much. The most insignificant things require paperwork, and a lawyer can be an amazing defense. 
Sometimes, I learned to be weary of people who are too nice to me, even if they don't know my background. I've been burnt too many times trying to help my friends (been sued a couple of times after loaning money to someone, had my reputation dragged through the gutters, and death threats are always fun). I've learned that with friends and money, sometimes you need to just choose one.A family friend of mine happens to have been a minister of finance of an Asian country (I can't say who, but I can say the country has a lot of money), one time he sat me down at his office and said that when people approach him about money, he always pulls out his wallet and says "sure, here's $20, have fun". 
Take it from me, you're giving her more than what money can buy. One of the most valuable things I have in my life is someone who I can trust completely and actually be myself around.
Oh the supporting myself part doesn't scare me, it's the failing to live up to my parents' expectations part that does. It's something I'm working on, but have yet to really accept. Most decisions I make is still with my parents in mind.
&gt;Do you subscribe to any philosophical group/ideology?My mother is Christian, my father is Buddhist, and I'm an agnostic, I suppose.&gt;Are there any that you find particularly fascinating? I've always been somewhat intrigued by Islam, not necessarily for the faith, but more for the culture. &gt;It seems like you are a pretty humble person, but have you ever (or even thought about) going out on your own and getting a crummy minimum wage job and surviving off to see the world from a different perspective? I try to give myself things like that every once in awhile-- I worked at retail for about a year, just to experience it. Frankly, it didn't change my perspective much because I never really felt the "fear" of scarcity that many people go through, because no matter what, there's always a voice in the back of my head that I can go back to comforts.
&gt;Did the money have a factor in how the kids behaved?Kids at my school was extremely competitive, in everything. My school had a ranking system based on grades, and I've seen girls who can kill to get a number higher. One year a girl at my highschool was beaten and raped because she pissed off another girl. I really hated that environment.&gt;What does your family expect of you, if anything?They want me to be a good representation for the family, I think. Reputation means a lot to them, and has real ramifications in their lives. &gt;Do you feel being handed everything you needed growing up without having to earn it the way most kids do had a negative effect, or are people who say that just jealous? heh.There's definitely two sides to the coin, I felt like I had difficulty really seeing the world from those not around me. I started a project when I was in my last year of highschool going around to talk to homeless people. I'd buy them meals and just listen to them chat, there's some great stories there, but I always felt kind of guilty for doing it.
I think I'll give them advantages in schooling and whatnot, probably support them through college, but I'd want them to grow up in a different environment than I did. 
What... is that?
Not really. My current bf is from a blue collar family, and has very different values than my parents, I think. It's never been a problem for us though.
I've seen it, and no, not nearly as much drama. I couldn't relate to the young female character, but I have friends who remind me of them. There's a certain air of "I want it and I want it now" that tends to be around, and I've never really identified with that.
It's incredibly cliche, but sometimes I do feel like those in a blue-collar background has more fun. In my upbringing, appearences matter a lot. You can't just do whatever you feel like without facing real consequences. If I got arrested for underage drinking, my dad could lose a client who is afraid of bad publicity. I don't know many "poor people" jokes, but I've always enjoyed this one: "How do you know when a rich person is lying to you? His mouth is moving."
I like that you started from zero.0) Why do you call yourself a Sad-Panda and not a happy one, inspite of the riches? Is it yourself alone whom you find unhappy, or all of you? Is money a reason for your unhappiness?Sad panda is just from the south park episode, where a character dressed up as a panda teaches about sex abuse and constantly says "it makes me a sad panda". I'm not that unhappy right now, but I felt that my family was always unhappy growing up.1) How do you deal with realizing that whatever you take for granted, is a luxury for someone else? Does a pitcher of beer ever remind you that there may be people who don't get basic drinking water, being in a glass and being cold notwithstanding? Do you still feel happy in drinking it?I've accepted that the world is extremely unfair, and I'm extremely fortunate in my place. I'll never have to think about whether I'll get water, or if my family's life will be in danger from war lords. I don't think about it constantly, but I do appreciate what I have.2) Would you give all you have to get back all the sweet nothings that you couldn't experience, because of the way your mom and dad are?I would gladly give up everything I own to see my parents happy and together again. But they're content right now in their own way, it just hurts me to see the distance between them.3) How did you learn the value of money? Were you tempted to just get with the luxury of having a lot of money, or did you really care about teaching yourself about the flipsides too? How would you teach your kids the value of money, inspite of the fact that you have enough money to keep a few more generations in luxury?I think I'd make them work, and not tell them about the luxuries. My mom was pretty good at keeping me thinking I was middle-class until I started realizing how untrue that was. 4) How easy is it for you to trust people? Does it bother you that they might simply be after your money? Do you think it's possible for people in different economic strata to be comfortable around each other?It depends, I try to keep people I don't know at a distance if they know about my background, and I don't reveal to people about my upbringing unless absolutely necessary.5) How many suckers have actually been after you, just for the money? How have you treated such people?Fortunately, I've never encountered something dramatic. There are always people around who want money, some who actually need it, and some who just like to have more. 6) Would you ever give up your world to go live with someone poor who loves you? Would you accept a simple, uncomplicated life for that person's sake, rather than survive richly but unhappily?Absolutely. My boyfriend considers himself to be poor, and I wouldn't hesitate if he asked to marry me. I'm just a regular person at the end of the day.7) Do you have the courage to live in say, Ethiopia (as those natives live their everyday lives) for a fairly significant time (say, a year), without having anything of what you have today? What would you miss most? If you did go to places like these, what would you say might be your most profound, enlightening experience?I think I would be afraid of dying. I lived in Thailand for a few months once just for the backpacking experience. I traveled with very little money, but was comfortable. Ethiopia would be a bit too much for me, I think.
I haven't seen it before, but I think I'm pretty aware when people are hanging out just for the money. I don't have any ill will towards them, people have asked me for money, or asked me to get my parents to give them money, all my life. They're human beings acting like human beings, I have friends like them, but I do hesitate when trusting them.Do you have a portfolio/proposal? I'm not really into the movies thing, but if you have something to show I might be able to forward it to people who know more about it.
:D Thank you.
I have a very good friend who is deeply in debt. He's never asked me for a loan and turned it down when I suggested helping, but he knows about my background. He's never held it against me.If your friends look down on you for ANY reason, they're not your friends. Money and friendship, sometimes you got to choose one.
I'll look into it, I hear Rod Blagojevich was holding a sale awhile back, 50% off.
Friends or money, sometimes you gotta choose one. It sucks, but money changes people sometimes.
I don't work in the family business specifically, although I try to help my dad occasionally. My parents are pretty conventional in that they expect my brother, the family son, to take over. They expect me to get married.The backstabbing is usually towards the entire family. Things like try to get us blacklisted from places, break up our friendships, trash our reputation, things like that are all fairly common. Not necessarily successful, but the attempts are common.
Chinese, English, French.
Yoga sounds like fun, actually. I dabbled in it for awhile but never got deep. I'll take a look, thanks!
I can't say I've ever tried that, and, sorry to say, not that interested. :p
Oh sorry, I thought I answered it already-- I'm 22. I attended an all-girls private school, but I lived at home. I've always been kind of jealous of people in public schools though, they seem to have so much more fun.
I enjoy my studies, and I LOVE reading. Sometimes it's like being able to live multiple lives in a matter of days. I'd say my biggest luxury spending goes toward books. 
Damn, busted. :p
:D Thank you! South park is genius.
True, I guess my biggest thing is I'd want to protect them from having to play multiple facades just to get through the day, and end up not knowing who to trust.
I think it's important to ease them into it, but most of it's education. I'd need to really make sure they know how to MANAGE money, rather than just knowing how to make it (which, in my case, is even more important).
It was during wartime and general unrest. The government put a LOT of money into manufacturing because of rebuilding necessities, and it just snowballs from there, I think.
Thanks for that, it does make me feel better. I think it's just the guilt that I honestly am extremely fortunate, so to ask for more is just greedy. I'm relatively happy right now, and I can't complain about life.
English, Chinese, French. I'd like to eventually pick up Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, and German.
Yep. :)
Contact them! :D They're great, really friendly people, and have some great programs. 
Long story short: A friend of mine wanted to borrow some money to start a cosmetics store. I made the transfer (stupidly without a lawyer present), thinking she'll just pay me back once the business got started. Everything was great for a few months, she was sending me pictures of the construction and whatnot, and it seemed like a genuinely good investment. A few months later of having put this out of my mind, I got a call from my lawyer telling me I'm getting sued.Turns out she had taken loans from several places, and ended up driving the business to the ground. Her biggest debtor came to her for money but she just declared bankruptcy, but because I gave her a loan without any real paperwork, I was considered a partner. So she sued me for my "share" of the losses. It got ugly very quickly, and it almost got my parents' assets involved. Fortunately my genius lawyer was able to take care of it, which is why now any major spending I do goes through an accountant. 
Ouch, that's like reverse elitism. I've never really experienced this, how are you dealing with it?
Mandarin, usually-- it's the official language. Cantonese is more a dialect.
Oh interesting, I've always thought Mardarin is the official language and Cantonese/Shanghainese etc are dialects. I can read Chinese, and write a little bit. Parents sent me to Chinese school for some time.
My dad's Chinese, so I learned both growing up. French I learned in school.
That dramatic, eh? I'm surprised, I've rarely encountered that kind of animosity before.
Introduced by my bf, who is a total geek. I've been converted. :) 
I can totally see this, pirates lived a life of plundering and lawlessness, wheras Ninjas usually worked for their masters. I guess I too, would rather be a pirate.
This is actually pretty common when I was growing up. I was given pretty nice toys and I enjoyed sharing them with my friends. Most of the time, the toys wouldn't come back, so my mom sat me down and taught me to be careful who I share it with. It never occurred to me that people would take advantage of what I had until that moment. When I first started living on my own, I had friends over all the time. Some of us were well off, and some less so, so we always accepted that some places we went we could cover for those who didn't have the means. After awhile, some people would get used to this and start coming over often, for food, rides, make up, etc. At first I didn't mind because I just felt like "why not, we're friends", but I realized they rarely called me unless they needed something, so gradually I stopped returning their calls.I had a friend who borrowed and crashed my car once, and she was from an above-average income family. She never once apologized or offered to pay for it, I didn't mind the money, I just felt kind of used-- what am I, you're personal piggy bank? The funny thing was that she crashed my car into her garage and her mom called MY parents to replace the garage door.
I enjoy meat as much as the next guy, I got my name off of an episode of South park... just sort of stayed with me ever since.
Personally and globally are actually pretty similar to me-- I'd like to go into nonprofits, but as to what field I'm not sure yet. My biggest issue is with the improper treatment of children though-- the way most orphans are raised in certain places of the world is horrendous, it will seriously shock the senses out of you. Some of left, literally, to die in a crib so they have less to feed.
Definitely check out Europe, you really understand why America is built the way it is. There's not enough sense of history in North America compared to Europe, and Paris is just gorgeous in general.
HEY! I live in Canada right now!But yeah, the North Pole is literally just a plot of land. There was, however, a Santa house you can see.
True, but most people in the world has problems without money, and I feel bad placing my problems as somehow being more important then theirs.
My Macbook Pro, Shure e500 headphones, my Marc by Marc Jacobs bag (sorry to the baby cows who had to die for this), and a watch that my boyfriend got me.These are the things I would not relinquish no matter how much you paid me. Ok, maybe I could do without the bag, but then I'd have nothing to carry my computer.
Does it bother me? Hmm... to be honest (and you can absolutely hate me for this), not really. I never felt like I deserved anything I have, I've just felt like I've been extremely fortunate. The world isn't fair, which is why I went through a disillusioned period and worked for Oxfam after highschool. Your mom sounds like an amazing person (I can't imagine raising 3 kids alone), and I wish her well, but I've come to terms of what I was given. It does bother me *tremendously* when I see people living without access to water, or are sold to slavery, or are trying to get through extreme poverty, but that's not because of what I have-- I just feel like no one should EVER be without the right to live. 
I'm 22. I used to work in retail for about a year, and I worked for Oxfam. I also volunteered for a few other non-profit organizations. I read most of the time, either online or off. I don't do the party thing. I'm not married but I do have a boyfriend. 
Nope. Although my dad does have a large vault of gold coins he likes to swim in (jk).
I've heard that-- "Riches don't pass the third generation". I don't forsee it happening though, since it's mostly due to the wastefulness of the last generation. I'd have to set it near Norway, and adopt Norwegian laws. Also, it will look like Norway, except for the Narwhal flag.
Sexual harassment.(I was going to leave it at that but then realized what it would look like for those who don't get the South Park reference). I'm not actually sad.
That was a really nice story, you've got a good talent there. I've seen people spend money in strange ways. I once had a friend who flew in a massive hand-carved ice sculpture of a fishtank for a party. I have no clue how much it cost but I couldn't help but think how ridiculous it was since it would just melt by morning. I've also seen a friend cut a $10,000 check to a homeless guy, because she was in a really good mood and he complimented her. I've never done either, but things like this isn't out of place.Most people I've met are very reasonable though, so a hospital is entirely possible.
&gt;Where did you grow up? Everywhere. United States, Canada, China, South Africa, Europe. Up until I was about 9 years old I didn't have a stable home. &gt;Who made the food when you were growing up?The cook, sometimes food would be delivered by this company that cooked specialty meals everyday. &gt;How many live-in nanniesI had one nanny that I remember well. She was there for everything, from school to bathing. During that time I pretty much saw her as my second mother. I still miss her a lot, but we lost contact. The other nannies would come and go and were mostly to make sure we were fed, etc.&gt;How close to your extended family are you? My father was an only child and my mother has one sibling. We're moderately close, but we don't see them often. Their children are much older than I am.&gt;Is your mother's family also involved with your grandfather's business?Nope, they met and hit it off, as far as I know. There is a discrepancy between my cousin's and my lifestyles, but it's not dramatic-- they're living comfortably and have never asked for money as far as I know. I've never really been close to my cousins.&gt;You had 3 cars all at one time while in highschoolMy mom got me a car (a Toyota Camry) while my dad was away. He came back and wanted to get me a better car (a BMW). I lent it to a friend of mine who got into an accident, and my dad got me a new one (a Lexus). I didn't care too much about cars, but my dad did.&gt;What's the logic behind you having a $5 mill house of your ownMy dad lives in Shanghai, and my mom wanted a new house, so they bought it. After awhile, my mom went to LA for business, so I lived there alone. I've since moved out to my own place, but my family still owns it.&gt;How much did Mel Gibson pay for that painting?I have no idea, I've never even seen it before.&gt;Which place is the most luxurious/exotic that you went to?A resort in Bali. It was a villa with its own pool, guest house, and full staff. We stayed there for a month one summer.&gt;Does your family own a private jetNope, but my dad has a corporate jet that we sometimes use. &gt;a yacht (How long?)Nope, my dad doesn't like water. He once talked to a fortune teller that said he'll die in the water. It took 2 months to convince him to take a cruise since then.&gt;fantastic vacation house (Where?)?We've got a place in Miami that's very nice, I've only stayed there a handful of times, but it had a gorgeous view.
Unfortunately, Santa wasn't home that day. I do like poutine though.
This is far deeper than I've ever considered my existence. 
Right now I have everything from European policies to Guns Germs and Steel. When I was young, I would go to second hand bookstores and pick up their "boxes" (a random collection of whatever it is they aren't selling). Whatever I finish or get bored of, I send to the library. 
Not much anymore. I've learned to let it go, it just stung when it happened. She's normally a very sweet and generous person though.
:) Thank you.
I still occasionally do, but I don't have one where I currently live (I moved out for college).I've never tried/wanted a Fazioli, I know it's Italian and some of the best in the world, but it never really seemed necessary. The one I had was a Steinway Model B.
Your story sounds amazing. I can't imagine it's easy for you to go through what you're going through, and I understand the pride you're talking about. Don't apologize for the rant, I'm happy you allowed me to share a part of your life, and I do hope you feel better. Money is a tool at the end of the day, like anything else. It doesn't define us as people and it shouldn't cloud our judgement of others (despite the fact that it's so easy for us to do so). In my opinion, however, you should learn to allow others the pleasure of helping you. I remember a quote from Tony Robbins, who is himself a multi millionaire, having a meal with a friend. The friend is much less wealthy than he is, and was moving to cover the check. When Tony raised objections, his friend told him that it is a genuine pleasure to give to others, and asked why he would deny this experience. Tony relented. This is sort of the reverse story, but sometimes it's more courageous to accept the help of others than to reject it.I wish you the best in everything that you do. I'm sure you'll have far more wealth than I do someday, and you'll be able to help millions in return.
The scary thing is that everyone *does* know. 
People are good, it's just not necessarily easy to see through the bad that makes it easier for them to get through the day.
Oh... I think I might have given you the wrong idea... um... well let's just forget about this whole conversation.
Nothing that I ever really got concerned over, the only threat my family ever took seriously was one threatening to kidnap me, including a picture of me at school. It turned out it was someone looking to undercut my dad's business and wanted him to back out of a contract.I know, I live the hard-knock life. :p
Rarely, I've had the occasional chance run-ins, but aside from these the most "types" of famous people I've met are politicians. I seem to run into Jermey Piven a lot, he's always wearing the same trenchcoat walking around in L.A. I've also had dinner with Samuel Jackson once at a friend's birthday party in New York. I can't remember the name of the restaurant, but it had a giant Buddha in it-- he was very down to earth. What else...I met Johnny Depp at a bar, but we didn't get a chance to chat much, and I was introduced to Leonardo DiCaprio at a hotel in South Africa. 
Haha, I don't consider myself a philanthropist at all. It's the same anyone, including yourself, would probably do in my position. I'll check out questu, I've been actually learning a lot today about various organizations that help others. Thanks for the tip!
Oh, I think i was mistaken-- I thought it was some kind of charity thing -_-. 
Vancouver-&gt;Toronto
I don't know, maybe it's the private vs public school movies in the 90's or something. There were just a lot of restrictions that were around in day-to-day life. Our theater department would *only* put on Shakespeare plays, there were very strict rules as to what you can and cannot do for creative/ artistic projects, and of course, recess and lunch breaks were largely just discussion fields.
Being a patron to... ? If I recall correctly our family's sponsored a few libraries and art museums (and a garden, for whatever reason), is that what you mean?
Hamlet, right? Shakespeare seems to have all the world's wisdom recorded in those few pages of his. 
Hahaha no, not really, but I did always want to invest in a movie or TV show that I want to watch that got canceled. An example is the 4400, or Kings (although I still hold some hope they'll approach HBO for new seasons).
It might, I can't speak for that, but it might also bring new problems. I think it's more dependent on simply the person you are.
Yes, once! The people are gorgeous there, it was actually shocking. It's like someone took a South American Models catalogue and just walked them all to one place.
No, but I think the new reddit soap looks really cool.I used to work for Oxfam, and retail before that. I'm not working right now since I'm a  full time student.
Antenna heat generator? Sharp edges honed from Chinese Sword master? That doesn't sound good...
Cool, I'll check it out, thanks!
Teach them how to manage money. My parents were nice enough to get me a few books, including a couple by Robert Kiyosaki on financial management that's great. Don't give them things just because they ask, make the justify the purchase.What my dad is doing with my lil brother is pretty cool-- every time he wants to make a major purchase, my dad makes he fill out a form complete with a market study of WHY this is the best purchase available, then approach it as an investment. I kind of wish I was taught that.
**HUGGGGGGG**
I've considered something like that. Our family has a charity program where 10% of our earnings go directly into it every year, then someone is delegated to decide where that money goes. Most of the time it goes toward a project like drilling water pumps somewhere in Laos or something, and I'm occasionally allowed to tag along. I had a life changing experience one year when I went to Vanuatu to see them start a sexual education program that taught young women how to empower and protect themselves. Maybe I'll suggest them try something in North America, specifically for helping out people in debt.
&gt;Do you prefer to socialize with rich people or with poor people?To me, they're just people. I've met nice and mean from both, there's practically no difference. &gt;Do you get that all the time?I have two groups of friends, one from my childhood and one from more recently. The more recent group of friends don't know anything about my background.&gt;Have you ever used a $100 dollar bill as kindle for a fire?No, that kind of stuff (brazen show of wealth) is generally frowned upon.&gt;would you ever consider trading places with her?Like in the movies? I'd probably try it for a month or two just for the fun of it, but I doubt it would turn out very well.
My family has a charity program where 10% of our earnings is funded directly into it, I think once it went to set up a scholarship or a grant at a local community college. 
I have a brother, but I don't think he's gay, sorry! 
I know one year our family started a scholarship/grant at a local community college, where the requirement was not based on grades but rather on community service. I think I'd be interested to seeing that through again.
I don't think I've ever seen that movie.
Toyota Camry, BMW M3, Lexus SC430. My dad has a S600 that he doesn't really drive, so I sometimes take that one out.Where I'm from depends on when you're asking. I grew up in the U.S. (LA), Canada (Vancouver), South Africa, and China. Since then I'm living in Toronto. 
I really have no idea how this works. I'm not nearly as business-minded as I should be. I can ask my father the next time I see him though.
I'm not hoping for sympathy, just because my family was unhappy when I was growing up doesn't mean I am any less fortunate! I'm actually pretty happy right now, I think people might've misunderstood my original statement.
&gt;How do you feel about estate taxes? Do your children have the right to inherit everything you leave behind, or should the government take its share as they currently do? Is wealth earned by one's parents truly earned?My father was pretty concerned about this awhile back, so he divided up a lot of the assets into several areas. Apparently this is pretty common. As for whether wealth earned by one's parents? No, I don't think I "earned" it at all-- there's no "deserving" here, it more or less just is.&gt;You mentioned you work for Oxfam. Do you find it difficult to be motivated to work hard, knowing you don't have to?Not at all, I loved my work with Oxfam, it was one of the most exhilarating experiences I've ever had.&gt;Have you ever done something involving separating yourself from your wealth and family for a period of time in order to live like a person of average means, or less than average means?Kind of, right now I'm living in I guess a pretty normal life. I don't drive, I don't live ridiculously, just comfortably. Most of my friends don't know about my background-- so all in all I seem to be living average means. &gt;If you could trade your wealthy unhappy family for a poor but tight-knit family, would you?In a second.&gt;Can I suggest a few worthy causes that could use a donation if you find yourself inclined to spend a bit of cash improving the world?Thanks for the suggestions, microloans are what's fascinating me the most right now, and I'm looking to get started with Kiva. I'll have to check out the other ones you sent me.
I'll let you know as soon as I have one to give!
hahaha no, I've never experienced that. I do occasionally stop in the middle of my day to just take in how lucky I am though, but it's less to do with wealth I think, just for the fact that I'm alive, I have friends, I'm comfortable, I don't live in fear, and I have people who love me. Immediate gratification is nice, but the drug wears off quickly.
Hahaha I meant I used to live in Vancouver, now I live in Toronto. And there's plenty of non-flatness in between! Have you ever seen the stampede?
Yep, but he didn't when we met. I think he sort of figured it out on his own as time went on, we never had a "talk" or anything like that. I have a very common name, but if you searched my dad's name you might find something. 
I didn't really get an allowance when I was much younger-- if I wanted something, I just asked for it. After hitting about 16-17, I was just given a credit and debit card, I think my parents trusted me not to overspend.
I've been meaning to see that! Everyone who has seen it has told me to watch it.
No allowance per se. I haven't really kept track of my spending habits much, but maybe a few hundred-a couple thousand dollars?
About a couple of years ago in the summer, we stayed in Rio and Sao Paolo. The food was also amazing.
This will sound incredibly shallow, but sometimes when I have a bad day I'll go and buy some ridiculously lavish flowers, which does brighten my life by quite a bit. Whoever said money can't buy you happiness obviously hasn't met my florist. I'll check out collapse, is it anything similiar to GGS?
Yes, we seem to be spreading, aren't we? Maybe the government's been breeding us in chambers as some kind of apocalyptic warriors filled with melancholy and credit cards. Perhaps I should make it my mission to bring this draconian organization to its death-- that should be a challenge enough.
I'm 22, and the next time I come down I'll definitely let you know!
Really? I like the Lexus better, personally. It feels easier to drive and it's cuter.
I met Chomsky once when he was giving a talk on Isreal. Brilliant mind, if only he didn't speak in a monotone all the time.A coke in the sun is something I think is universally enjoyed. :)
I think it was called Seadream. It was a pretty small ship.
That's true, I have a friend obsessed with his Corvette, which I've always thought was hideous. Men and women have very different ideas on how cars should look.We got it around 2004 I think, though it was white. 
Do you own a Fazioli? How is it?The last suite I worked on was Pictures at an Exhibition by Mussorgsky, a couple years back-- never had the patience to finish learning it, but I've thought about going back. I don't really have a favorite composer, but me and Bach never got along. 
Bach was just dry for me, there's variation but it felt boring. Try out Pictures at an Exhibition, there's a lot of freedom between the movements. I agree, when I get a chance I'll return to playing, it's such a beautiful instrument.
They really really desperately need to. Or rather, Kings desperately needs HBO. That show is too good to be canceled, or God forbid, given to Fox.
That's a really good point, I've never thought about that before... how do I get over the guilt then?
I used to have a BMW M3 and a Lexus SC430, but I live downtown now where there's really no point to drive. I did used to speed when I was younger, I wasn't the safest driver. I didn't mind the price of speed tickets that much, but it was still not a good feeling. Now I drive much more responsibly, but it's moreso because I stopped finding the pleasure in driving fast.
I love Yann Tiersen, first heard about him a couple years back when a friend sent me one of his albums, and I kept it on replay as I travelled through Europe. Him and Richard Clayderman are probably my two favorite recent composers. 
It depends on the limitations that the trust is designed, but usually yes, I believe you're only allowed to use or control a certain set amount (or %) of the money per year. 
Do you mean total net worth? I've never really asked, but I would guess ~9-10 depending on what kind of assets are involved. My parents want me to get married. I'm absolutely serious-- I can do whatever I like until I'm ready to get married and have kids. 
That's a hard question to answer... most of my friends and I as children have played at one point or the other the "poor people game" (I sincerely apologize for how offensive this sounds), where we pretend to be beggers or whatnot, so the fantasy element has always been there growing up. Since I've been able to sort of come to consciously understand the world, however, that fantasy went away. Money is a tool, and depending on how it's used it can reveal different outcomes. 
I enjoyed Carnegie's *How to win friends and influence people*, it has some absolutely amazing gems of wisdom inside. I've never read anything by Jay Abraham though, but I'll check it out. The aspect that fascinated me the most about marketing is probably organizational behaviors, and the way people think in groups. Regarding your question: We lost quite a bit in the last couple years despite the fact that my dad had predicted what would happen and had been preparing for it since 3 years ago-- I had a chat with a couple of my dad's advisers about it, and the general gist I got is that the next round of major economic powers are being born right now, but it's done in a very different way than what we've come to expect. To answer your question very simply, the outlook is very good for the next couple decades. We're going to hit a rise in the next 18 months, consumer confidence will rise, and then we'll hit a drop in about a year after that where the market will look pretty ugly. Some of the TV personalities right now are saying the worst is over, but it's mostly empty rhetoric trying to raise morale for people to invest in stocks again.After that is when the major foundations of the next generation of power players will be built. Anyone who can keep afloat during the next 5 years will see some nice rewards-- given that they're in the right industries. It's funny that you mentioned buying houses in 3 separate areas, because the next 3 years isn't a bad time to do so. The big what-if right now is Europe, not the Mid-East, and the best friend we have right now is China, as one would expect, because China controls European markets. Another what-if is in energy, which can really turn either way right now-- everyone is sort of looking at Obama on that one, but he's been doing a pretty good job right now despite public opinion.That said, take my little rant with a HUGE grain of salt, I'm merely playing telephone here and I've never been very good at that game.
I've never thought about that-- our family has a strong mentality that whatever we have as a family, we have individually. I struggled with the independence thing for awhile but have come to accept what I have as a part of who I am.Let's say someone wins the lottery and gets an unlimited amount of money. For the first couple of years chances are he or she will go do everything they've thought they should do or should want, and then after awhile that just sort of goes away (you can only lie on a beach for so long, after all). It's what comes after that defines the person, including "independence".
I do mostly what everyone else does, I'd imagine. Hang out with friends, school, read, etc.
I've definitely lent people money (some return it, some don't) a few times, but unless I know what people are going to do with money, I'm less inclined to help. 
From most people I know who work when they don't have to, it's from the pleasures and social obligations of working. We all need a purpose in life and a reason to get up in the morning, I suppose.The funny thing is, most people in middle class have more than enough money to move to some island, and live very very cheaply (&gt;$100/month). They just choose not to because they prefer the comforts here.
Haha, it's fine, I actually haven't thought about checking here for about a week until today. I did get a few more PMs than I expected, but most people are very friendly and non-judgmental here.Thanks for the kind words, I think I'm really a very very normal boring person, and was expecting a lot more questions about how the people around me deal with finances (the "rich people mentality"). Instead people were more interested in who I am, which was very nice. I think regardless of income bracket you'll find the entitled just as you would those with inferiority complexes. &gt;I can't help but think nearly everyone in your age group from a background similar to yours would have massive superiority complexes.There is, I can't deny that (even though I want to), because a lot of them do grow up with pretty much the understanding that they can do just about anything they want to. Everyone has a team of "LBDs" (Lawyers, bankers, doctors), it's kind of ridiculous sometimes. I don't think I do anywhere near the amount of charity that I should, but I was glad to see that a couple redditors actually got some investments through this post. &gt;Are your parents (namely your father) expecting (and by expecting I mean forcing) you to marry someone rich and/or Chinese? I doubt they'd force me, but they have expressed that they'd feel happier knowing the man is from "a good family". They don't really stress the money issue, but they expect me to live a comfortable life. I have a feeling that my dad would try to force whoever I marry to work with him though, just to keep tabs. Nationality doesn't really matter to them, it seems. My mother is American, and my dad's companion is Chinese. &gt;Their parents were basically going to arrange their marriages to rich, older Chinese men for business/inheritance purposes, and the penalties for not obeying their whims were basically disownment and estrangement .I've seen a LOT of this, from various cultures. I actually lost one of my closest friends from India due to this. She got a call from her mother one summer while she was in highschool telling her to come visit, and then the next message I got was that she was forced to marry as soon as the plane landed-- I haven't seen her since. It's so common with the oil kids (usually middle eastern families) that it rarely surprises anymore, some families have their spouses chosen by birth, and it's not that big of a deal after awhile. I'm lucky in that it wasn't the case for me, and I think it's mostly due to the fact that my father had a LOT of arguments with my grandfather about his marriage-- had he not been the oldest son there would have been a good chance he would've been disowned.
I suppose it's varying degrees, and I'm probably more cynical or weary than most people, but you're right, it certainly isn't something we expect from good friends. Best of luck, zaekrex!
