What you need to realize is that she probably doesn't think twice about it, unless you say something, because money inherently is less valuable to her (regardless of whether or not she is wasteful). If she felt like you were mooching, or not worth it, she would either say something or leave you, and if your relationship isn't strained, then there more than likely isn't a problem (however, most of what I know about women involves accepting the fact that it's impossible to understand them).\n\nThink about the fact that if she didn't feel you were important, she wouldn't waste her time with you, because if she's well off and (I'm assuming) relatively attractive, she could easily find a man in her tier of wealth to replace you with, but she hasn't.\n\nDon't take it for granted, but don't constantly remind her that you appreciate the money gestures either.

{"body": "&gt;How much control do you have over your money? Is there a filled-up bank account that's fully yours, or does everything flow through your parents, or just your father?\n\nI don't have a dollar to my name, per se-- all the money is under my parents'. \n\n&gt;How do you see your wealth affecting your path through life? Will you work? Will you work at a job that's fun? Will you work at a job that makes you even richer? Will you work at a job that doesn't pay well, but does something good in the world?\n\nI've answered similar here, but the gist of it is I'm looking to go into nonprofits.\n\n&gt;Do you mostly have rich friends? Have you tried to make friends with people who don't know about your wealth? Do you often worry that people like you for your money, and not for yourself?\n\nMy general mentality when it comes to money and friends is \"choose one\". I've had too many 'friends' who stop calling after a loan or \"business venture\". I have a group of friends from my childhood who tend to be rich but share the same philosphy toward money, and I have a larger group of friends who are from various backgrounds.\n\n&gt;Do you feel like your wealth translates to power? Can you get away with things that most people can't because of it? Can you user your wealth to influence politics or business?\n\nIn certain areas of the world, yes. I'm not going to pretend money doesn't make things easier or that people won't treat you better. I find a VERY large discrepensy between how people treat me with and without knowing about my background.\n\n&gt;When you daydream about your future, do your dreams involve being rich, or being normal/anonymous?\n\nI prefer anonymity, by far. I don't tell most people about my family. People act very differently towards me when they find out, they tend to either become guarded or demanding.\n\n&gt;What's are some of the biggest misconception out there about very rich people?\n\nWe're normal people.

He insists on taking care of me, but I find it's ridiculous when we go to a restaurant and he's obviously concerned about the bill.\n\nThat's pretty much me. I shaved off my stipend for a month to take her out to this really nice Japanese place, and a week later her dad comes into town to take us out to an even nicer place and ends up paying more than three times what I paid. I still enjoyed it, and it felt really good to pay for it. She was really, incredibly, moved by it but at the same time I can't help but shake the feeling that... I don't know. It's not like she's humoring me so much that I'm humoring myself, like I'm tricking myself into thinking this is anything more than a kind gesture. Blegh. It's really confusing.\n\n&gt;It took a while for me to convince him that he takes care of me in other ways than finances. He makes me happy, and if he's not happy, I'm not happy. In a way, I'm investing in my own happiness. Our agreement is that if one of us want something more (i.e. if we're travelling and I want to stay at a better hotel for comfort and safety while he's comfortable with the $20 hostel), we'll cover the difference. So in the hotel example, He'll pay the $20 that he would have at the hostel, and I cover the hotel fees because it's something I want.\n\nThis is actually a pretty good compromise. I'm the least picky eater (I ate ramen and dollar-per-pound rice prior to meeting her), and I'd honestly be just as happy eating nothing but steamed vegetables and noodles all the time, but it really grates on her. She is very into fine dining and nice hotels and everything. The nicest hotel I stayed at before I met with her had by-the-hour rates. I guess it kinda makes sense for her to \"pay the difference,\" but then I feel like I'm justifying tagging along for the ride :P\n\nYour responses have been nearly identical to hers, I think, and in total it actually makes me really happy to know that this response is rather normal for the situation.

There are horror stories there, but also a lot of amazing adventures that you can really only have when people have nothing much to lose, working a job that they don't care about, for a boss that expects nothing from them.\n\nSimilarly, some of my best experiences were traveling on a tiny budget in distant places, like the time in Thailand when I was too cheap to take a taxi/tuktuk from the bus stop to the train station, and I had a local scammer try to become my friend so he could sell me a trip from the travel agency that he worked for.  I walked probably 5km in 40C heat with 20kg on my back, with this guy telling me all his adventures and guiding me to his travel agency.  When I got there, I managed to scam enough time on their computers to check my email, tell my buddy I was on my way, then slip out to the train station next door.\n\nIf I'd just taken a taxi from the airport to the train station I'd never have that story (not to mention all the other ones from that trip, like the ultra-budget jungle tour guide who had a musket blow up in his face (he wasn't hurt but his face was black just like in the cartoons)).\n\nWhat do you mean by the fact you're terrified of being the \"poor little rich girl\" cliche?

I'm not that unhappy right now, but I felt that my family was always unhappy growing up.\n\n\n1) How do you deal with realizing that whatever you take for granted, is a luxury for someone else?

My mom was pretty good at keeping me thinking I was middle-class until I started realizing how untrue that was. \n\n4) How easy is it for you to trust people? Does it bother you that they might simply be after your money? Do you think it's possible for people in different economic strata to be comfortable around each other?\n\nIt depends, I try to keep people I don't know at a distance if they know about my background, and I don't reveal to people about my upbringing unless absolutely necessary.\n\n5) How many suckers have actually been after you, just for the money? How have you treated such people?\n\nFortunately, I've never encountered something dramatic. There are always people around who want money, some who actually need it, and some who just like to have more. \n\n6) Would you ever give up your world to go live with someone poor who loves you? Would you accept a simple, uncomplicated life for that person's sake, rather than survive richly but unhappily?\n\nAbsolutely.

Were this a real scientific debate, you'd be done already. However, I'm willing to give you the benefit here, and I've found your study for you. \n\n&gt;http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v101/n1/full/6605098a.html\n    \nNote that fish eaters enjoy a lower occurrence of cancer with vegetarians, which leads exactly into my post above, where I mention the strong risk of cancer derived from charred meat. I'll expand on how it works with it in a minute.\n\nYou want proof that charred meat causes cancer?\n\nFirst we discuss the biology: There are several organic compounds in meat that are pertinent. The most important to our discussion are amino acids and creatine. Both of these are components of muscle tissue -- amino acids build, and creatine (which is an organic acid as well, fwiw) serves as an energy source.\n\nInterestingly enough, when overheated, and specifically, when charred, these two compounds form various heterocyclic amines, all of which are potent carcinogens. \n\nMore on the science later, let's delve into some sources:\n\nNot a peer reviewed article, but it's from a reputable source, (and no, the BBC is not a reputable source for science reporting): \n\nCharred meat increases risk of pancreatic cancer by ~60% [source](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090421154327.htm)\n    \n[This](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118804186/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0) describes how HCA's are formed in the charring of meat, and also that it causes tumors in many organs, including breast, colon and prostate of rodents. Also affected primates.\n    \nThe researchers found that those who ate their beef medium-well or well-done had more than three times the risk of stomach cancer than those who ate their beef rare or medium-rare.  [source](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/heterocyclic-amines)\n    \nAs for intelligence to minimize the risk, not only is \"not charring\" a great technique for eating meat safely, it was found that several marinades, such as lemon juice and olive oil, can drop the HCA production by as much as 90% [source](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T6P-3RH6CJC-1N&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=114e3161adc6a0bd231a011353cb95a7)\n\nMeats that were microwaved for 2 minutes prior to cooking had a 90-percent decrease in HCA content. [source](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/heterocyclic-amines)\n    \nAn HCA validation study (more proof that HCA causes cancer, if you still need it) [source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19588936?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum)\n    \nAdditional studies have shown that an increased risk of developing colorectal, pancreatic, and  breast cancer is associated with high intakes of well-done, fried, or barbequed meats.[source](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/heterocyclic-amines)\n    \nBasically:\n\n* Red meats are the worst, chicken is second, fish is last. \n* The less cooked it is, the safer it is\n* There a ton of methods that almost completely remove the danger, including marinading and microwaving\n\nI tried to use less 'impossible to understand' sources, but if you want to question the validity of my softer sources -- go ahead, I can follow them with links right out of journals.

{"body": "You're fortunate on one axis out of a large number of independent axes of fortune.\n\nOne of the reasons I liked Slumdog Millionaire is that it showed that in many ways, kids growing up in just about the most poor circumstances you can imagine still go through some of the same ups and downs as everybody else.\n\nYou may never have to worry about where your next meal is coming from, but you get the huge guilt burden of being wealthy in a world where so many people are so poor.  If a kid from the slums doesn't make anything of their lives, it's no big deal.  The mere fact they survived is a triumph of sorts.  Being well off means that the bar is set a lot higher, and you have fewer excuses.\n\nFundamentally, we're all just apes.  While the problems of someone growing up in a slum are more visceral, this also makes them easier to deal with.  Animals have been struggling for food, shelter and clean water forever.  Someone living in a slum doesn't have the luxury to worry whether the meal they found has too much saturated fat.  All they know is that they got enough to eat for one more day.  Having your most basic needs always met just opens you up for a new set of opportunities and problems, and ones that as apes we're less well equipped to deal with.\n\nSure, I could go down to McDonalds and get a hamburger.  I can easily afford it, it's completely legal, and it's unlikely to be tainted in a way that will kill me immediately.  On the other hand, I'm educated enough to know that McDonalds isn't healthy in the long term.  I know it will provide me with the calories I need to get through the day, but I also know that it doesn't come close to meeting my nutritional needs.  I also know that the way McDonalds gets its beef is not good for the animals, and not good for the planet.  Then there's the advertising that they use, which I know draws in kids, and helps contribute to the obesity of the world.\n\nNow, simply feeding myself has become this huge ethical minefield.  There's the stress from the paradox of choice, and the knowledge that even the simplest decision has far reaching implications.  This is something that the ape brain really isn't all that good at dealing with.\n", "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "author": "immerc", "created_utc": "1248213322", "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_9366p", "parent_id": "t1_c0b9unm", "distinguished": null, "score": 7, "retrieved_on": 1426002944, "controversiality": 0, "id": "c0ba164", "subreddit": "IAmA", "ups": 7, "name": "t1_c0ba164"}

{"body": "&gt;Where did you grow up? \n\nEverywhere. United States, Canada, China, South Africa, Europe. Up until I was about 9 years old I didn't have a stable home. \n\n&gt;Who made the food when you were growing up?\n\nThe cook, sometimes food would be delivered by this company that cooked specialty meals everyday. \n\n&gt;How many live-in nannies\n\nI had one nanny that I remember well. She was there for everything, from school to bathing. During that time I pretty much saw her as my second mother. I still miss her a lot, but we lost contact. The other nannies would come and go and were mostly to make sure we were fed, etc.\n\n&gt;How close to your extended family are you? \n\nMy father was an only child and my mother has one sibling. We're moderately close, but we don't see them often. Their children are much older than I am.\n\n&gt;Is your mother's family also involved with your grandfather's business?\n\nNope, they met and hit it off, as far as I know. There is a discrepancy between my cousin's and my lifestyles, but it's not dramatic-- they're living comfortably and have never asked for money as far as I know. I've never really been close to my cousins.\n\n&gt;You had 3 cars all at one time while in highschool\n\nMy mom got me a car (a Toyota Camry) while my dad was away. He came back and wanted to get me a better car (a BMW). I lent it to a friend of mine who got into an accident, and my dad got me a new one (a Lexus). I didn't care too much about cars, but my dad did.\n\n&gt;What's the logic behind you having a $5 mill house of your own\n\nMy dad lives in Shanghai, and my mom wanted a new house, so they bought it. After awhile, my mom went to LA for business, so I lived there alone. I've since moved out to my own place, but my family still owns it.\n\n&gt;How much did Mel Gibson pay for that painting?\n\nI have no idea, I've never even seen it before.\n\n&gt;Which place is the most luxurious/exotic that you went to?\n\nA resort in Bali. It was a villa with its own pool, guest house, and full staff. We stayed there for a month one summer.\n\n&gt;Does your family own a private jet\n\nNope, but my dad has a corporate jet that we sometimes use. \n\n&gt;a yacht (How long?)\n\nNope, my dad doesn't like water. He once talked to a fortune teller that said he'll die in the water. It took 2 months to convince him to take a cruise since then.\n\n&gt;fantastic vacation house (Where?)?\n\nWe've got a place in Miami that's very nice, I've only stayed there a handful of times, but it had a gorgeous view.", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "author_flair_css_class": null, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "IAmA", "author_flair_text": null, "downs": 0, "author": "Sad-Panda", "created_utc": "1248217086", "archived": true, "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t1_c0b9xjb", "distinguished": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1426002971, "controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_9366p", "ups": 2, "id": "c0ba34z", "name": "t1_c0ba34z"}

Do your children have the right to inherit everything you leave behind, or should the government take its share as they currently do? Is wealth earned by one's parents truly earned?\r\n\r\n2. You mentioned you work for Oxfam. Do you find it difficult to be motivated to work hard, knowing you don't have to?\r\n\r\n3. Have you ever done something involving separating yourself from your wealth and family for a period of time in order to live like a person of average means, or less than average means?\r\n\r\n4. If you could trade your wealthy unhappy family for a poor but tight-knit family, would you?\r\n\r\n5. Can I suggest a few worthy causes that could use a donation if you  find yourself inclined to spend a bit of cash improving the world?\r\n\r\n[Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition](http://www.ccdconline.org/) -- the president of the board of this group is an old family friend and a wonderful fellow. They really help a lot of people not only practically but also with intangibles like finding a sense of community, respect and friendship. Unfortunately the recession has hit them really hard and they might fold soon if they don't get some grants and such.\r\n\r\n[Friendship Bridge](http://www.friendshipbridge.org/) --Microloans for impoverished women in Vietnam and Guatemala who want to start businesses. I give to them regularly.\r\n\r\n[Hope for Animals](http://www.hfaccr.org/) -- I used to foster kittens for them. Denver has a Pit Bull  ban and this is now one of only a couple rescues in the state that will take in Pit Bulls and find them new homes. Most shelters will take them but just put them to sleep immediately, no matter how healthy and friendly they are. But there are of course always WAAAAY more Pit Bulls than they can actually take.\r\n\r\n[Autistic Self-Advocacy Network](http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/) -- So, you know Autism Speaks, right? Well, they're assholes. They won't let any adults with Autism be involved in their work or serve on their BoD.

(considering that I was in a bout of depression after graduating college, which I did not even realize until friend/redditor jopejope pointed it out to me, which took me many years to get out of) \r\n\r\nMoney only brings you happiness under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nIf you're so poor that you can't or have to struggle with providing you and your family with the essentials (food, shelter, clothing etc. ) you are pretty much in the unhappiest section of the population. \r\n\r\nHaving money that provides those things can bring you temporary happiness. But once the essentials are taken care of, the amount of happiness money brings is in a state of diminishing returns. \r\n\r\nAnd the amount of money you have is always relative to the people around you. If you have slightly more money than most of the people around you, you tend to be happier, but if you have much more money than everyone around you, then you tend to be less happy. Even if you had a lot of money but you still have less money than everyone around you, you still tend to be less happier.\r\n\r\nWe are mostly under the impression that money brings happiness because we live in a materialistic society. Because we get bombarded by commercials of products, and constant promotion of brand names. While in truth, money is just a very small factor when it comes to happiness. \r\n\r\nSo what brings real happiness? Time and time again, it has been shown the important things that brings happiness are these: \r\n\r\n1. A healthy relationships with the people around you (your family, your friends, your siblings, your children), \r\n\r\n2. A sense of belonging to a part of a community (friends, workplace, sports teams, church etc.), \r\n\r\n3. A sense of self worth (that you are making a difference, that you are important and unique in your own way)\r\n\r\n4. A long term life goal to work towards (creating and providing for your family, career goals etc.).\r\n\r\nThese are the things that I have realized over the years are the important factors when it comes to happiness. This is also the reason why people with and without money can be both happy and unhappy at the same time. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps to anyone who is looking for happiness or might be in a state of depression. Does anyone want to add anything to this list?  \r\n\r\n", "ups": 2, "controversiality": 0, "name": "t1_c0ba5pj"}

If you like Anthony Robbins, you might want to look at [Jay Abraham](http://www.abraham.com/); the two collaborate a fair amount, and Abraham will show you the practical side of marketing that is more immediately applicable to small-mediium business scales, which gets closer to the level of marketing you are likely to enjoy applying to your non-profit intentions, where you will have to be creative with limited resources to accomplish goals.\n\nHe's a devotee of Carnegie's *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, and while he acknowledges the quantitative side of marketing he gets more into the communications angles. With as much as you say you have voraciously read, complemented by your English Lit. and Marketing degrees, you have a good chance to blend them together in new ways with some of the practical approaches to marketing that Jay teaches. A lot of people don't stick with his material long enough to grok it, so you can pick up his mega-course packs on eBay cheap to get a feel for his style.\n\nTo the question, then: what does your dad or brother think is the US economic outlook from now until about 2030 (that is, roughly about the next generation time span), if they were confronted with having to live only in the US?\n\nI ask because I wonder if there is a streak of optimism in highly successful business owners. My best friend is independently wealthy, and while he sees some slowness in the next year or two, I'm busy expanding my business to a global client base and moving my family and business offshore from the US as soon as we can because I think it will get progressively worse in the next 15-20 years. Another friend who runs a very successful hedge fund is likewise pretty sanguine about the long-term economic outlook. The small business owners I know like myself however, are fairly glum (though only one among a handful I've talked with actually is as alarmed as I am).\n\nWhile I don't consider myself rich, as was gently pointed out to me while I was drinking a Dark and Stormy at the Soggy Dollar Bar after we moored our chartered catamaran, I'm not exactly middle class, either. Yet, I'm not going to feel I have provided for my family until we have homes in at least three separate areas of the world, because I think global unrest will increase in the future at an alarming rate, and I can't clearly tell whether that projection arises from my nature, my father's background (our family fled one of the last century's communist revolutions), or because small business is intrinsically a volatile existence and that colors perceptions (though with each passing year as my business stabilizes even more, to the point where I now readily see why people say after 5-10 years, most businesses have a vanishingly small chance of failing, and I'm mid-way through that range and shouldn't be worried any longer).

{"body": "I enjoyed Carnegie's *How to win friends and influence people*, it has some absolutely amazing gems of wisdom inside. I've never read anything by Jay Abraham though, but I'll check it out. The aspect that fascinated me the most about marketing is probably organizational behaviors, and the way people think in groups. \n\nRegarding your question: We lost quite a bit in the last couple years despite the fact that my dad had predicted what would happen and had been preparing for it since 3 years ago-- I had a chat with a couple of my dad's advisers about it, and the general gist I got is that the next round of major economic powers are being born right now, but it's done in a very different way than what we've come to expect. To answer your question very simply, the outlook is very good for the next couple decades. We're going to hit a rise in the next 18 months, consumer confidence will rise, and then we'll hit a drop in about a year after that where the market will look pretty ugly. Some of the TV personalities right now are saying the worst is over, but it's mostly empty rhetoric trying to raise morale for people to invest in stocks again.\n\nAfter that is when the major foundations of the next generation of power players will be built. Anyone who can keep afloat during the next 5 years will see some nice rewards-- given that they're in the right industries. It's funny that you mentioned buying houses in 3 separate areas, because the next 3 years isn't a bad time to do so. The big what-if right now is Europe, not the Mid-East, and the best friend we have right now is China, as one would expect, because China controls European markets. Another what-if is in energy, which can really turn either way right now-- everyone is sort of looking at Obama on that one, but he's been doing a pretty good job right now despite public opinion.\n\nThat said, take my little rant with a HUGE grain of salt, I'm merely playing telephone here and I've never been very good at that game.", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author": "Sad-Panda", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": "1248916727", "archived": true, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "IAmA", "parent_id": "t1_c0bgm2p", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1426007285, "controversiality": 0, "id": "c0biv7n", "link_id": "t3_9366p", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null, "name": "t1_c0biv7n"}

I came into this submission expecting a \"woe is me\" post, followed by a bunch of jealous redditors shitting all over it while being refuted with variations of \"I'M RICH BITCH'.  It's really awesome to see how wrong my expectations were, as you honestly seem like a genuinely nice and sincere person.  I grew up and (and still live in) Orange County, CA.  I've personally never known anyone with parents anywhere near as rich as yours, but there are still tons of entitled bubble teenagers/young adults living quite well off of their parents (I'm one of them), and your humble demeanor is extremely refreshing for someone who has access to even more than what's typically available to people growing up here (which is still far more than your average American ever gets).\n\nI can't help but think nearly everyone in your age group from a background similar to yours would have massive superiority complexes.  I love how you want to do non-profit work and actually contribute to the betterment of society, and I'm completely shocked that you actually responded to requests from redditors for donations/investment considerations.  I know lots of people probably refuse to feel any pity or compassion for the issues you've described due to the fact that your family is rich.  I think the point you bring up concerning the perception of extremely rich people by everyone else is really interesting, but I think it's important to consider that this notion of superiority or some sort of transcendence away from common humanity is something that is propagated by many rich people as well.\n\nI actually have a question concerning your parents and plans for your future marriage.  Feel free to not answer any of this stuff, and sorry if this was addressed, but there are a ton of posts in this submission.  I saw that you mentioned that your parents don't care who you date, or what you do until you decide to get married.  Are your parents (namely your father) expecting (and by expecting I mean forcing) you to marry someone rich and/or Chinese?  Also, what nationality is your mother?  What about the mistress?  \n\nSorry if these last two questions or any of the other ones are too personal, I'm honestly just curious.  I have known two Chinese girls who were very well-off (albeit not nearly as much as your family) yet understandably upset by the notion that they were under the complete control of their parents, not only financially but emotionally as well, even after high school.  Their parents were basically going to arrange their marriages to rich, older Chinese men for business/inheritance purposes, and the penalties for not obeying their whims were basically disownment and estrangement .  One of them was being courted (I guess that's the right word...?) by a guy seven years older than her while still in high school.  I'm actually intrigued by your father choosing to marry outside of his race because it seems to me like something that successful Chinese businessmen (especially those in a line of businessmen) rarely do because of social constraints and expectations imparted by their families.\n\nThere's actually a bunch of other stuff I'd love to ask you if you're still checking replies to this post, but I'll leave it at that for now.", "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "gilded": 0, "edited": true, "author_flair_text": null, "downs": 0, "author": "wrathofg0d", "created_utc": "1249434742", "archived": true, "subreddit": "IAmA", "parent_id": "t3_9366p", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1426010666, "controversiality": 0, "id": "c0bpeoi", "link_id": "t3_9366p", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null, "name": "t1_c0bpeoi"}

I don't stand to profit in any way! Feel free to PM me if you want to discuss more, but I am definitely NOT the right person to take you beyond friendly discussion.\n\nThere are several very good firms out there, and a good discussion with them about what you want to use your money for can really help you to make sure that you get the most out of your contributions. It's really like having an investment advisor, except you're getting advice on how to invest in charitable causes. They'll help you find the kind of investments that best meet your goals, preferences, and circumstances. \n\nFor example, what do you think would make you happier and feels most natural to you:\n\nSmall amounts to a wide variety of recipients for a wide variety of purposes. This option gives you the most spontaneity, but the overall impact might not be as much. \n\nSelecting a particular type of purpose and giving small amounts. You might decide, for example, that the arts mean the most to you, so you concentrate on supporting artists or art organizations or arts education. One of the benefits of specializing a bit is that you get to learn more and more as you go along.\n\nThe opposite approach is to become very focused on just one or two organizations or causes and to make just a few big gifts, what are often called \"transformational gifts.\" It might mean the difference between struggling and thriving for a particular organization or community or person, or bringing a whole new service to a community, or picking five or ten people to send to college. The advantage is that it's a lot easier to see what you're accomplishing, but the disadvantage is that  it can be a leap of faith to pick the one or two that you concentrate on and if there are any problems, you'd feel more let down than if it were the occasional gift of pocket money, so to speak.\n\nAll the best to you! \n", "edited": false, "archived": true, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author": "boccanegra", "subreddit": "IAmA", "author_flair_text": null, "downs": 0, "created_utc": "1249830730", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "score_hidden": false, "distinguished": null, "parent_id": "t3_9366p", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1426013386, "gilded": 0, "id": "c0buj8l", "link_id": "t3_9366p", "ups": 0, "controversiality": 0, "name": "t1_c0buj8l"}
