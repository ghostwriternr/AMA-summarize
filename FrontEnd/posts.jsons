By the time the process was through (6 months), there were 5 open positions.  I'm not mathamatologist, but (I think) that means the top ~.4% were hired.  However, when the economy was great, people wanted jobs that made them money.  So we'd have 30 applicants for 3 openings.  That means the top ~10% get hired.\n\nThe problem is that any test in any job or school has an acceptable lower limit.  Let's say, for argument's sake, that during the hiring process, any score of 70% or more is passing.  That means the applicant that scores 98% on his written, physical, oral board, command board, etc will get hired.  But it also means that the applicant that scores 71% on his written, 72% on his physical, 78% on his oral board, and 75% on his command board will also get hired if there are enough positions.\n\nI encounter this as a field training officer as well.  I have cadets that come through that just aren't good.  They aren't.  But if they pass everything at a 71% rating, they are released to full duty.  And it pisses me off to no end.  Because by releasing them, I am basically putting my stamp of approval on them and sending them off.  Trust me, EVERYONE in the department knows who trained who.

I make pies.\n\nAs a minority growing up in NYC, you're probably more likely to be taught that cops are dangerous and to be avoided than be taught that the policeman is your friend, because that's been the experience of so many members in the community.  As you get older, the fear turns into resentment and the resentment (often for young men) turns into lack of respect for the police, which often turns into being abused and/or arrested on something trumped up because you were being mouthy or disorderly or whatever.  On the cop end of things, I'm guessing that the young minority male is classified as volatile and dangerous and often disrespectful, so the cop feels he has to assert his authority and control over the situation, so when the kid starts talking shit, the cop reacts by \"subduing\" him (to put it in the kindest way possible).  An overreaction like that to what's seen as a kid just running his mouth fuels the parents in the community to tell their kids to just avoid cops for their own safety, and there goes the cycle again.\n\nSo you have this ongoing wheel of fear and distrust on both sides of the uniform and the role of the honest police officer breaks down into the old us vs. them mentality.

Gates was hostile and argumentative, yelling over Sgt, uh...name escapes me.  The Sgt asked/told him several times to stop yelling so he could answer Gates' questions.  This did not work.  Gates continued to get wound up.  Sgt stepped outside to get out of the poor acoustics of the kitchen.  Gates followed.  Gated continued to yell and carry on.  Sgt warned him several times to be quiet OUTSIDE of his house.  Neighbors began coming out to find the source of the yelling.  Sgt arrested Gates for Disorder or whatever specific charge.  I have no problem with that.  However, everyone knew, based on his demeanor, and status, that this would be an issue.

SO if your vehicle is stopped when you were smoking pot (a hypothetical argument, not an allegation) and the officer can smell the odor of burning marijuana, he has exigency.

Long story, but does that make sense? \n\nFinally, I don't like being lied to.  I don't tolerate it from my children, and I wont tolerate it from strangers.

TV shows and movies featuring law enforcement characters typically portray police officers of all kinds of backgrounds and personalities who do their jobs for all kinds of reasons and with all kinds of methods. There are usually good cops and bad cops of many different sorts. Whether or not any of these shows ever portray actual police work well, they do seem to portray police officers as human beings with as much variety as any other profession. There are funny cops, sad ones, bullies, 9-5ers, driven ones, brilliant ones, dull ones; cops of every kind on these popular entertainments. \n\nYet despite the popularly of these shows and the characters on them, people are still so easily willing to stereotype police officers in real life as only one or two kinds of people, and usually not people they'd want to have a drink with or admire for their cleverness or bravery. \n\nDoes that seem odd to you, or do cops shows and both their content and popularity just seem super odd in general. Perhaps they don't seem odd at all?\n\nWhen ever I find myself thinking ill of a police officer (or at least warry is the right word, I wouldn't say I'm wishing ill of them at all) I think, but why should I assume he's a bully and not a [Dutch Wagenbach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Wagenbach) or a [Bunk Moreland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunk_Moreland)?  Of course I don't expect anyone to be just like a fictional character, but why would I find these characters so believable and admirable and then still so often fail to think of any given police officer, \"Maybe this guy is a nerd just like me trying to do his best to help people\" or \"Maybe this guy has  real genius for solving crimes and the work ethic to do it the right and legal way.\"  I can only assume it's fear that might lead myself or others to forget how willing we are to admire police work in a fictional setting but be suspicious of it in our own lives.\n\nIs this whole line of thinking kind of stupid on my part?

{"body": "Thanks for your reply! I know you said you wouldn't justify it, but I really wish that you would. Let me try to be direct even though I admit the source of the question is a bit philosophical and idealistic. \n\nThe natural followup is how do you justify, to yourself, the obvious double standard? That is, you obviously don't like it if I, a citizen, lies to you. In fact as you pointed out, it's generally illegal. But you, a representative of the government and all the authority that entails in curtailing my freedom has /essentially/ carte blanche to lie to me.\n\nI'm not trying to call you a liar here.

And you have the green light to deceive me. So why should I, Joe Shmoe Citizen ever trust you John Q Law?\n\nCan the police really not do their job if the same law that applies to the interaction of citizen to police officer applied in reverse? It is my understanding that the effectiveness of the police is reduced if the citizenry doesn't trust them. Is the trade-off, i.e. being allowed to lie to us, really worth the corresponding increase in mistrust?\n\nAgain, thanks for your time.

{"body": "I wish that we could speak in person.  There is so much to discuss here that typing back and forth could take forever.\n\nHere's how I'd like you to look at it.  Imagine you or a loved one are victimized.  Not raped or killed, or some extreme.  But something very realistic.  Let's say you are at school or work.  You leave your desk for a moment, and when you return, your cell phone is gone.  If you're like me, you'd be pretty pissed off.  It's only a cell phone, but come on...it's YOUR cell phone.  And someone took it.  So you call me.  And I show up, and you express your anger to me, and ask me to help.  All you can say is there's this guy that's in the same area, that kept turning and looking at you before your phone was gone.  So I approach this cat and ask him \"Did you take that guys cell phone?\"  And he says \"nope.\"  Case over.  You're screwed.\nHowever, if I go talk to the guy, and he's nervous.  He appears evasive.  His story doesn't really make sense.  Based on my experience (and you have to grant me the fact that experience in ANY field counts for something) I can tell that this guy is not being perfectly honest with me.  So I call him out.  I tell him, \"Look.  The school cafeteria has cameras.  I'm gonna go look at the video right now.  What's the video going to show?\"  Most people will lie, until they are back into a corner, and no longer feel they have a logical lie left.  So this guy thinks about it, and realizes that if I look at the video, I will see him taking the phone.  So, he hands the phone over.\nAt no point did I violate his rights.  I didn't even have to search him.  I just presented him with information that made him think I figured it out.  And you get your phone back.\nIn the end, I could give a shit if you, the victim, want to prosecute or not.  I'm not here to put that guy in jail.  But I am here to get you your phone back, and to prevent you from being victimized.\nNow lets go to the extreme.  A child predator.  A detective interviews him.  And to start a relationship, the detective empathizes with him.  Tells him he understands.  That his niece walks around in her panties too.  And that she's basically asking for it.  The offender feels a sense of trust and connection, and opens up, and starts talking about what he did and does.  Is that a good thing?\nTo me, they're little white lies.  I hate the term \"ends justifies the means\" but I guess that's what it is.\nIf I never lied.  Ever.  If I talked to suspects and said \"Look, I don't have a fucking clue as to what happened, but are you willing to admit to it?\"  I'd clear a lot less cases.  And unlike most people like to think, most crimes do have victims.  And if you've ever had your stuff broken, damaged, stolen, or whatnot...you know it sucks to be a victim.\nNow, if I, as a government agent lie to you.  Tell you that if you confess it will keep you out of jail.  Or otherwise lie to violate your rights.  That's wrong.  \nOk.  That rant is over.

{"body": "I guess there is a lot that could be debated here. In the end it seems that it is largely academic and my stance possibly too idealistic. However I really feel that allowing the police to lie to us is a slippery slope. One that relies on the personality and honor-ability of the officer and the department that empowers him/her.\n\nAs an example of this lets take a real case. I'll admit first off that I am biased in this case as it was the state against a relative of mine, however I feel it's a good enough example of just how slippery this slope is, and the problem of what I think is a loose definition of entrapment (granted I'm not a lawyer). The case is that of an 18 year old college freshman; we'll call him Joe. Joe quite frankly is immature, no question. Joe is caught one night smoking marijuana by the police near campus (a more serious offense in this state) and brought in. The cops tell him they are his friend, they understand, that they really want the \"bad guys\": the dealers. If Joe tells them that, then no harm no foul. So Joe does and Joe is not arrested. Now the police know him and Joe thinks he got off the hook. A few weeks go by and another undercover officer sees Joe outside a bar smoking dope again. The officer knows Joe, but Joe does not know the officer. So the officer goes up and makes friends. Eventually the officer asks Joe if he knows where he can get some cocaine. Joe being the \"resourceful\" guy that he is says sure, he knows someone and will go get it. So he does. This time of course Joe is arrested, and for a far more serious offense than smoking dope. Further he is once again within the radius of being near a school (the college); even worse for Joe. The system has him by the short and curlys now. They have him selling cocaine near a school, and they have a record of him smoking dope near a school earlier, so it's a serious offense and there is no entrapment as they have prior evidence that Joe is the sort of person to do drugs; which here is apparently as good as selling drugs. Joe gets 14 years.\n\nSo is this right? I of course don't believe so. In fact I feel pretty strongly that the police haven't caught a real criminal at all, they caught a pretty dumb kid doing a very dumb thing. Of course I'm not trying to justify Joe's actions, cocaine is a pretty serious drug. On the other hand the police did everything in their power to let Joe set himself up. They sat back, I would even argue encouraged him to let him mess up even more, and then crucified him. By letting him off the hook the first time, they were setting him up for an even bigger mistake in the future. Of course many argue that it's not the job of the police to counsel people like Joe. And I guess they're right. Then again I know that when I was growing up I had many visits to my public school starting at a very young age from \"Officer Friendly\". He told me that if I ever had trouble, I could trust the police. That the police were there to protect me. Well, frankly I don't feel that way anymore. And I don't have just this one little anecdotal story to reaffirm my suspicion. In fact I count my lucky stars that I'm not a minority or I'd really be screwed; at least according to the arrest statistics I've seen.\n\nSo what's the point? I'm not really sure I have one. It's not that I don't respect the police or want the police gone. That would be insane; people do some pretty horrific things to one another and a society without consequences is bound to collapse. On the other hand asking me to trust someone simply because they have a badge? Well, call me paranoid and untrusting, frankly I'm not so naive as Joe to think that the police are really there to protect me. Officer Friendly is a lie, and a dangerous one for the rights of the individual in a free society. If you are allowed to lie to me, I'm never going to trust you if I don't already know you. Maybe that's wisdom that should be employed regardless... But then when not so long ago an officer came to my apartment one night and asked me if I had been in the parking lot that night I had no idea why she was asking me such a question. At 11 at night I was stuck with this situation: If I lied and said no, I was committing a crime. If I said \"yes of course I live here\" I had no idea if I was just admitting to something which may help her prove my guilt for something I don't even know about. So I took the third option, to ask her why she was asking such a question. Turns out they are apparently looking for a man that was found breaking into a little girls room across the street and chased off. So I said that I hadn't seen anyone that looked like that to me that night. The absolute truth, I have committed no crime, and I hope that I have helped the police make our neighborhood a safer place. I still don't know if the officer was lying to me though. It could have been a little deception on her part to get me to admit that I had been in the parking lot that night. How am I ever to really know? And how long was she delayed in finding this creep because I had to take my time and make certain I didn't admit to anything if I could possibly help it. A trivial example, I know, but realistic. Luckily I had the self-education, and wherewithal that night not to lie out of fear and haste, and the police caught the guy regardless of my confusion and paranoia.\n\nSo, I'm not going to trust you. It's as simple as that. When you pull up next to me, look my way, or talk to me, my guard is going to be up. Yours is. For all you know I just murdered a kid and have his body in the trunk of my car. For all I know you are out to get me, and you can say whatever you please to get me to admit to some sort of guilt. Frankly that's a pretty dim reality to me, though I guess the alternative is untenable. Am I wrong? Is there a law out there that protects me from the less than honorable on the force? Or officers simply making mistakes and miss serving justice by going after me? Am I really so wrong to have my guard up every time I see you and I think of Joe? Do I really have to teach my future kids that Officer Friendly is their friend, but that they should never speak to him without a lawyer present? I sure as hell hope that that guy crawling into little girls rooms in the middle of the night never visits my house...\n\nSo thank you for being an honorable officer with the best of intentions; you have no idea how much I appreciate the work you do. Forgive me however when I look nervous and forget my manners every time I see you, I'm scared of jail.
