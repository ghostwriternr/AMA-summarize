Your brother's murder happened about the time that many states began trying people that committed heinous crimes as juveniles in adult court; prior to the mid-80s this had not typically been done for 40 years or so (and then typically in the south and typically towards blacks). As likely applied in Mathews case, the supreme court in 2012 ruled that sentencing a juvenile to life without parole represented cruel and unusual punishment; and thus was a violation of the constitution.\n\nSo to an extent, Matthews sentence would have likely been different had he committed the murder a few years earlier or a few decades later. It obviously hard to put yourself in different circumstances, but do you think, had he been sentenced under more modern laws (or the system in effect prior to the mid-80s) and likely been released from prison by now, do you think you would have been angrier or more frustrated than you are with the current situation? Do you think you'd just found the peace to move on (while, of course still being angry about it?) Do you think the supreme court was right in saying that 14 years old should not be allowed to be sentenced without the possibility of parole?\n\nI feel such empathy for you. My nephew was murdered by my cousin and her husband (he was their nephew as well). They also murdered 3 other people. The husband it getting out of jail, i think, this year, after about 14 years and his wife, my cousin, get out, I think, in three years. It seems insane.\n\nThat said, I also am understanding of the Supreme Court's reasoning about juveniles and basing their decision on the development of young brains and their abilities to fully make rational choices.\n\nAgain, I have such empathy for your situation... it must be so painful to have to relive this horrible crime again.",
